Hi. I have successfully setup my instance on vast.ai for training Gemma 2. My notebook is running. I just want to make sure that it keeps on running even if close the browser. How would that be possible [@kishanvavdara](https://www.kaggle.com/kishanvavdara) [@valentinwerner](https://www.kaggle.com/valentinwerner).
