# How to address the issue of performance loss when transferring trained model weights across different environments and devices?

Hi guys,

When I move my model weights to Kaggle after finishing training on my GPU server, I found a problem: the performance of my model significantly drops even though the data is the same as on my GPU server. How can I handle this problem? By the way, the only difference between Kaggle and my GPU server is the versions of Torch and CUDA：

| kaggle | my gpu server |
| --- | --- |
| cuda 12.1 torch 2.1.2 | cuda11.8 torch 2.3.X |
| thanks for answering my question! |  |

> Different versions of Torch and CUDA can indeed lead to performance issues or even different behaviors in model execution. It's essential to ensure that the versions you're using are compatible and consistent. If possible, try to match the versions of Torch and CUDA on your GPU server with those on Kaggle. [Check here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to see the see additional information.
