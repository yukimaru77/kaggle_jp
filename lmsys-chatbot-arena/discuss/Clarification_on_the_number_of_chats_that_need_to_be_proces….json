        "content": "Hi,\n\nThe dataset description says \n\nWhen your submission is scored, this example test data will be replaced with the full test set. There are 55K rows in the training data, and you can expect roughly 25,000 rows in the test set.\n\nand the leaderboard says\n\nThis leaderboard is calculated with approximately 26% of the test data. The final results will be based on the other 74%,\n\nSo should we expect that the final submission on the private leaderboard will need to process ~75.000 rows?\n\n",

And the final score is hidden so that people don't probe, I guess?\n\nMy main concern was if the notebook will have to deal with more samples later. That's clear now, thank you again.\n\n",
