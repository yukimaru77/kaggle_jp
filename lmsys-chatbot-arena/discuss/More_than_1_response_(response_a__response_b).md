# More than 1 response (response_a / response_b)

Some of the rows in the test/train dataset have 2 or more response(s). Do anyone know if we need to make prediction based on all of the responses i.e., user will chose of of response_a or one of response_b.

Or if there is anything specified about that, that I am missing..?
