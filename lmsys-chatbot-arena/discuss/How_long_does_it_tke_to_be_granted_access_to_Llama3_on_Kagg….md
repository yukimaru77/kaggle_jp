# How long does it tke to be granted access to Llama3 on Kaggle? [Solved: 24 hours]

**CPMP** *Thu Jul 11 2024 19:49:54 GMT+0900 (æ—¥æœ¬æ¨™æº–æ™‚)* (10 votes)

I got access immediately yesterday on Meta's site, but my request is still pending here.

Edit: I got access after 24 hours, which is reasonable. It is just that I got access on Meta immediately which sets optimistic expectations.

But I got the error "Submission Scoring Error" when I submitted my notebook, I thought that I set the wrong format for my submission.csv. Then, I read the sample_submission.csv and change the the value of ['winner_model_a', 'winner_model_b', 'winner_tie'] columns with my y_predict. The worst thing is my notebook ran successful but when I submitted again I got the error "Notebook Threw Exception", please help me!
