        "content": "Today, I stumbled upon a GitHub repository that seems tailor-made for this competition. Prometheus 2, available in two sizes, 7B and 8x7B, claims to achieve state-of-the-art results in language model evaluation, Whats really intriguing is its claim that the 7B model outperforms Lama-2 70B and is on par with Mixtral 8x7B.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't have the time to personally verify these claims or participate in the competition. \n\nHopfully this comes in handy. Good luck everyone!\n\nPaper: [https://github.com/prometheus-eval/prometheus-eval](https://github.com/prometheus-eval/prometheus-eval)\n\nOffical Implementation [https://github.com/prometheus-eval/prometheus-eval/](https://prometheus-eval.github.io/prometheus-eval/). \n\n",
