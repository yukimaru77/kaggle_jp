Im new to kaggle.

Till now, Ive seen scores range in 0.5 to 1.7

I wonder how many is the perfect score so I can evaluate my score level.

Is it 5, 10 or 100?

This is because if we both write a prompt, we may prefer different responses - so how is our model supposed to learn which responses are better. Because the problem is this hard to predict, the "ceiling" of the score is much higher than 0.0 - more along the lines of 0.75 or 0.8 (just a gut feeling)
