I have converted Ultrafeedback data shared by [@thedrcat](https://www.kaggle.com/thedrcat) into competition data.

Unlike competition data, Ultrafeedback data has a rating. This means that the model with the higher rating is the winner and the tie is the "tie".

Please see that:

I would like to thank [@thedrcat](https://www.kaggle.com/thedrcat) for initially sharing this data.
