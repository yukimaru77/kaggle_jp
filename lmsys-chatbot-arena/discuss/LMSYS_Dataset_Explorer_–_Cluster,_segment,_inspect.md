Hey folks – Today, we’re releasing a free dataset explorer for the LMSYS challenge.

With our tool, you can browse through individual rows and inspect their content in great detail. We generated semantic clusters, and you can filter conversations by cluster, model pairs, winner model, and so on.

The tool is free and no login is required. Be sure to let the community know what you discover.

> As you are the the CEO of the company behind the tool, did you check the licenses? I am not sure if you are allowed to publish data from the competition on your platform, given the cc-by-nc license. I know that there was the recommendation not to do such in previous conpetitions.
