            "content": "Note that time difference between Submission and save come from the data difference. During saving (the success / error you mentioned) the test data only has 3 rows, during submission its 25,000 rows. A subset of these rows are used for Public Leaderboard (what we see on Leaderboard right now), while most IS used for private Leaderboard / the score we see once the competition finished, and which is used for actual evaluation in the competition placement.\n\nSo you are running A LOT more data during submission, increasing runtime for row based operations\n\n",
