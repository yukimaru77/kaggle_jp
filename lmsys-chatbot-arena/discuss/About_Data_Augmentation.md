# About Data Augmentation

The competition is coming to an end. As a novice, this is my first time playing Kaggle. I encountered many problems and learned a lot. I was constantly fine-tuning the model before, but I had never enhanced the data. Today, I have realized all my ideas about fine-tuning the model. I have started a new exploration on how to get a higher score. I have learned some knowledge about data enhancement, including back-translation method and EDA method, and I am ready to use EDA for the next attempt. At the same time, I wonder if you have other methods you are willing to share.

> At this point in the competition, I don't think adding any additional data is going to improve the score, training set is already enough, and training hours are quite long. Using external data didn't improve the score for anyone as far as I can remember from the discussions, but I'll be curious to see if it works.
