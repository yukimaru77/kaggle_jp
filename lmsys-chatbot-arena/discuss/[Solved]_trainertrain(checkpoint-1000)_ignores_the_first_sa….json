        "content": "My question is if trainer.train(\"checkpoint-x\") ignores the first samples?\n\nFor example, I first trained using 4000 samples as train_dataset and got checkpoint-200, 400, 600, 800 and the last checkpoint as checkpoint-1000. And then I resumed training using 4800 samples by trainer.train(\"checkpoint-1000\") and I got only checkpoint-1000 and checkpoint-1200 (no directory corresponding to 200-800). Does that mean the first 4000 samples were skipped?\n\nIn order to resume training using new training datasets, do we need to add the first samples as \"dummy\"? \n\n",

            "content": "Yes, resuming training involves bypassing the previously processed data. If you wish to modify your dataset, you can specify 'model_name' as 'checkpoint-1000' and subsequently fine-tune it using your 4800 samples.\n\nHowever, if you do so, your model will see the 4000 samples twice, is this what you want?\n\n",

That's why I experimented a bit and asked this question here. Your answer is very helpful. Thank you so much!\n\n",
