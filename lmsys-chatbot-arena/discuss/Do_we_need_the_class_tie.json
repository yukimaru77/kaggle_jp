To collect additional data, later in the tournament they also allowed the user to declare a tie in which both models were bad. There were a significant portion of tied outcomes.\"\n\nI hope it could help to clarify. I didn't read anything else about the ties on that Notebook or in their paper too.\n\n",

At least - I'm assuming \"winner_tie\" being 0's was a factor.\n\nFor my next entry - I'm going to try to fill in winner_tie based on the confidence of A or B winning.  Hopefully this improves things‚Ä¶\n\nIn the train data - it seems ties are very common (about 1 out of 3).\n\n",
