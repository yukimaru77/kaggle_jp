# How crazy！Top 1: LB 707 ——> 663!

I'm not sure how this guy managed to quickly move from LB: 880 to LB: 707, and then to LB: 663. I suspect his training plan is similar to those of other teams in the gold tier, but the training data might be very different!

Additionally, in a discussion thread titled “Suspicious Surge of Novice Accounts on the Leaderboard,” I initially thought these "newcomers" wouldn’t affect the Top 100, but this morning when I checked the leaderboard, I found myself around 80th place. I admit my guess was wrong.

Lastly, my teammates and I are discussing whether to make our training and inference solutions public today or tomorrow in order to counter these "potentially cheating newcomers."

> Please do not publish your solution before the deadline. This will do nothing but create unnecessary turbulence on the leaderboard by giving advantage to those who have enough time to incorporate your ideas. This imbalance will be even more amplified giving the time zone difference across the participants.

This is because I've noticed some teams were around 938 on the LB a few days ago, and suddenly they are around 900 today.
