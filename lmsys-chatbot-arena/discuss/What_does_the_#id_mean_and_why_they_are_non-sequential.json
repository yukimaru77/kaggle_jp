            "content": "Besides what has been suggested, you can think of the ID as sessionID,  a way to link all parts of the text if you decide to split them into separate segments; if look closer at the prompt (and also response_a and response_b), you'll see it includes several parts or segments of a discussion. If you split these into different rows, you can use the ID to piece them back together later.\n\n",
