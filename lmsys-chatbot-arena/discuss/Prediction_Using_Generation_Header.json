        "title": "Prediction Using Generation Header",
        "content": "This is still a tried and tested idea and has not yet been successful in my current environment, but I would like to share it.\n\nCurrently, from what I can see in public code, the mainstream approach seems to be to base it on Llama or other LLMs and use LoRA to train a classification head. However, LLMs are originally trained to predict the next token, so I think this method is inefficient as it diverges from the original training of the LLM.\n\nMy idea is to use the same generative header (CausalLM) as the original LLM.\n\nI adjust the prompts and use the generation probabilities of the tokens A, B and tie.ã€€The predictions are post-processed using softmax so that they sum to one.\n\nBelow is a simple sample code:\n\n```\ntext = \"\"\"\n### Instruction\nWhich model's answer is appropriate for the prompt?ã€€If both are appropriate, answer `tie`.\n\n### Prompt\n{prompt text}\n\n### A\n{response A}\n\n### B\n{response B}\n\n### Answer\n\"\"\"\n\ninputs = tokenizer(text)\nout = model(inputs)\npred_token_id = tokenizer.encode(\"A\") + tokenizer.encode(\"B\") + tokenizer.encode(\"tie\")\npred = out.logits[0, -1, pred_token_id].softmax(0)\n\n```\n\nHere is the code that evaluates this method using Llama3 8B.\n\n[https://www.kaggle.com/code/takamichitoda/lmsys-zeroshot-prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/takamichitoda/lmsys-zeroshot-prediction)\n\nLlama3 has not undergone any special fine-tuning and is used as loaded from the Kaggle model. The evaluation data uses 1/5 of the competition data, which is equivalent to my current validation strategy (correlates well with the public leaderboard).\n\nAs a result, we obtained a score of 1.234. It was surprising to me that I could achieve such a result with ZeroShot.\n\nCurrently, I am performing SFT on the competition data and adjusting the prompts. However, models that learn classification headers still score better.\n\nAre there others working on a similar approach?\n\n",

            "content": "I tried a similar experiment, primarily because I was hoping to take advantage of training and inference libraries for causal language models that are faster and more memory efficient than the HuggingFace transformers library, namely unsloth and vLLM. However, I actually finetuned the LLMs, as opposed to just doing zero shot inference like [@takamichitoda](https://www.kaggle.com/takamichitoda)'s initial experiment.\n\nI got 0.902 (CV) with Llama 3 8B Instruct doing next token prediction, which is almost as good as I've been getting with \"normal\" Llama 3 based classification models. However, the same approach did not work well with Gemma 2 9B (0.990 CV ðŸ¤®), possibly due to Gemma's tied embeddings. My CV scores are pretty consistently ~0.03 lower than the corresponding LB scores, so those results translate to ~0.93 & 1.02 LB, which isn't good enough for me to bother submitting.\n\n",

I think a more likely explanation is that the data provided by the competition organizers isn't perfectly representative of their test data. For example, they may have partitioned their data based on the date on which each conversation occurred, thereby causing the test data to contain responses from new models that aren't present in the training data (or my cross validation data for that matter).\n\nAlso, one consequence of the trendline having a slope < 1 is that the discrepancies tend to get bigger as CV & LB scores improve. Extrapolating to a ridiculous extent, a model with perfect accuracy in cross validation (CV 0) would likely score ~0.125 on the leaderboard, which is a huge score discrepancy.\n\n",

The model has basically no intent to predict \"A\", \"B\" or \"tie\" whatsoever, if it not finetuned to realize it should do so. Therefore, the logits are also pretty much nonesense. \n\nThis simple baseline experiment they did does not speak at all for whether their actual experiment will work or how well it will perform.\n\nTo me, at first glance I do not see any benefit over the seq class approach directly, as you still probably need to disable the autoregressive generation etc. But it definetly is an interesting idea\n\n",
