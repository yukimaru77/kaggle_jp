# What is the trick...

I find almost impossible to fine-tune with the recurses that we get from Kaggle, and at home not enough GPU memory.

What are people using?

External providers? Google, Azure, My Pods, etc.

Any suggestions?

What are people doing, on these type of competitions, Text cleaning, stop words removal, Stemming and lemmatization, etc.

Thanks for any tips guys.

It is up to you how much you are willing to spend and what experiments are worth it and I know there are a lot of platforms to choose from and price may vary based off what you need and your area. Some popular ones are runpod, vast.ai, google cloud, and then depending on your personal situation AWS or Azure may be more accessible but those first 3 are more likely and worth researching. No doubt I have missed some, but a good starting point.
