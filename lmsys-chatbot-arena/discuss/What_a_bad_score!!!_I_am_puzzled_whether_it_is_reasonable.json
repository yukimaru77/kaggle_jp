        "content": "I encountered inference score bad problem.\n\nI used gemma-2 to classify and got local cv(20% data) = 0.9366, lb=0.968.\n\nAlso, I used llama-3 to regression and got local cv(20% data) = 0.916, lb=0.934.\n\nWhat a bad result!!!.\n\nInspired by [@jsday96](https://www.kaggle.com/jsday96), so I tried to both inference on kaggle and local. The results are shown below. The results are train data head 10. The difference is very small. I am puzzled whether it is reasonable?\n\n",

I don't know why my local prediction is so different from the prediction on Kaggle, which leads to a big difference between cv and lb. I think this is the reason. This gave me new ideas. Thank you very much for your discussion.\n\n",
