# Is Microsoft phi3 allowed?

I noticed in some competitions that the host specifies certain dates after which models released are not allowed. This competition was launched on May 2nd, and phi3 was released on April 23rd under the MIT license. So, could you [@sohier](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier) [@paultimothymooney](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney) please confirm if we can use that model?
