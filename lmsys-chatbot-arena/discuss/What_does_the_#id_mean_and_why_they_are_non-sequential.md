# What does the #id mean and why they are non-sequential

We noticed that the #id column was not one-by-one and we wonder why. Is it because the datapoints not shown in the train.csv are cut out because they are not in English?

> Besides what has been suggested, you can think of the ID as sessionID,  a way to link all parts of the text if you decide to split them into separate segments; if look closer at the prompt (and also response_a and response_b), you'll see it includes several parts or segments of a discussion. If you split these into different rows, you can use the ID to piece them back together later.
