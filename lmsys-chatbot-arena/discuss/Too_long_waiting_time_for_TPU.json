You can raise feature requests and complain about stuff like this in Product Feedback: [https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-feedback?sort=published](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-feedback?sort=published)\n\nHowever, Kaggle provides these resources for free so you dont have to provide them yourself and to even out the playing field for these competitions a bit. I think its important to either be grateful for what Kaggle provides (of course you can still raise it in product feedback), or adapt & overcome and find a solution that works for you. There are many alternatives for the goold old GPU - which still works well ðŸ˜‰\n\n",

But they have quite a cumbersome setup process. Would much rather wait for kaggle's TPU for a few hours, but less TPU waiting time would be a blessing.\n\n",
