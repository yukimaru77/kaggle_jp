This needs to be downloaded \n\n```\n# Load model directly\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForMaskedLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google-bert/bert-base-uncased\")\nmodel = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(\"google-bert/bert-base-uncased\")\n\n```\n\nSo what to do? \n\nAre all the hugging face models in kaggle? \n\nshould I use a model that exists on Kaggle? \n\nor is there another way to use this one? \n\n",
