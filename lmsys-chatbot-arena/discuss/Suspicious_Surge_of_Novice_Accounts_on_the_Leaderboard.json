        "content": "I was at 45-50th place 2-3 days ago, and today I see that there are too many novice accounts on the top of the leaderboard. They merged up as a team and are getting similar scores on LB. When I check some of these accounts, I see that most were just signed up a few days ago. I don't want to blame anyone without concrete evidence but these movements in the LB seem suspicious given my previous experiences in the competitions.\n\n",

It is not surprising to see newcomers doing well IMHO.\n\nEach time there has been a paradigm shift in Kaggle competition, a new breed of top performers emerged. It happened with XGBoost, then LightGBM, then with CNNs, then with transformers, then with pretrained LLMs, and now with Lora and variants.\n\nThat being said I have no clue about the specifics of the people you target. If you have evidence of cheating then you should send a mail to compliance@kaggle.conm.\n\n",

How was this adressed in previous competitions? \n\nI am a bit torn on this:\n\n- If a person is selling their solution by simply adding 4 team members and carrying them to gold, I think that is fine for me?\n\n- If a person is selling their solution away to other teams, that would obviously be against the rules.\n\nI am wondering if the the second case is happening too. When looking at the top 100, several teams with novice or contributor as highest rank have a similar submission pattern and very similar scores.\n\n",
