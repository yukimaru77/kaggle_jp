# Solution file to be updated the week of May 28th

A Kaggle community member informed us that the hidden test set for this competition contains values that have already been published. We were aware of some existing public data, but not that there are actually different versions of the public data using one name. We will update the solution file to ignore the affected rows next week and then rescore all existing submissions. You are welcome to continue to make submissions in the meantime.

Thank you very much to the Kaggler that disclosed this issue.

To everyone else, apologies for the disruption and thank you in advance for your patience.

We used the latter to detect the leak.
