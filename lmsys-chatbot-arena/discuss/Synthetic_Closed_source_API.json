However, in past competitions there were winning solutions that used self-generated data based on closed source models where data was not shared to my knowledge. Those guys still got a very deserved first place. Therefore, I would assume it to be okay. \n\nHowever, for rule questions it is always best to ask kaggle staff directly. \n\n",
