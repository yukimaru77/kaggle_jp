        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nContinuing [the previous discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lmsys-chatbot-arena/discussion/508200), we want to share some more interesting observations.\n\n### Empty Prompts\n\nWe all know that there exist missing responses, either None or empty (now  detected with regex ^\\s*$). Today, we observe there are 5 samples with at least one empty prompt present during the conversation,\n\n[](https://postimg.cc/q6hgRT8P)\n\nMost of the time, models can continue to respond normally even if an empty prompt is sent by users. Another finding is that some models will throw an error message if an empty prompt is sent,\n\n### Winner is the Model with an Missing Response\n\nFor a single-turn conversation, we expect the winner to be the one with a non-missing response. However, there's an interesting sample in which the winner is the model with an empty response, \"\" . Looking into the prompt, we realize what's going on! The prompt says Please reply with “<|endoftext|>”.\n\n[](https://postimg.cc/GB9kYHnN)\n\nThat's all, happy kaggling!\n\n",
