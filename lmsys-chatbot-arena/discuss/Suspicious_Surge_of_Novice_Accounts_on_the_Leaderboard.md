# Suspicious Surge of Novice Accounts on the Leaderboard

**Sercan Yeşilöz** *Thu Aug 01 2024 07:46:45 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)* (44 votes)

I was at 45-50th place 2-3 days ago, and today I see that there are too many novice accounts on the top of the leaderboard. They merged up as a team and are getting similar scores on LB. When I check some of these accounts, I see that most were just signed up a few days ago. I don't want to blame anyone without concrete evidence but these movements in the LB seem suspicious given my previous experiences in the competitions.

I was thinking that did any expert share another great solution, but instead I found a lot of accounts which seems to registerd just recently and got same scores suddently came before me. Now I realize that some dirty things must happen. And I am still struggling to fight for the leaderboard. I will not surrender to those boosters. 😡

> Because some people are selling solutions to this competition on Xiaohongshu, there are cases where a mentor leads a team of a few people to participate in the competition and charges a fee. Especially in the days leading up to the competition team registration deadline, these types of posts appear more frequently. Each post has about a dozen or twenty people inquiring about the price. This issue has been discussed in previous posts: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal/discussion/366313](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-multimodal/discussion/366313)
