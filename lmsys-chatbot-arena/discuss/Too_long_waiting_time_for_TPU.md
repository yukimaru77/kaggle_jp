Hi Kaggler, 

Are you also facing too long waiting time/queue( sometimes more than 1 hour) for TPU usage? 
To whom should we raise this issue? 
What other options are you trying for TPU besides colab?

I think its important to either be grateful for what Kaggle provides (of course you can still raise it in product feedback), or adapt & overcome and find a solution that works for you. There are many alternatives for the goold old GPU - which still works well ðŸ˜‰
