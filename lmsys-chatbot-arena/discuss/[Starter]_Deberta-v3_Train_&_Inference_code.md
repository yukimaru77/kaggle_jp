# Intro

Hi, I wanted to share good train and inference notebooks. :)

- Pytorch Train & Inference

- Only prompt was used.

- I recommend adjusting token_lengh for your GPU memory.

- There are many things to try.

# Notebooks - v3

- Train : [[Train] LMSYS / Deberta-v3 starter codeðŸ”¥](https://www.kaggle.com/code/piantic/train-deberta-v3-starter-code)

- Inference : [[Inference] LMSYS / Deberta-v3 starter codeðŸ”¥](https://www.kaggle.com/code/piantic/inference-deberta-v3-starter-code)

# End

There is a lot of room for improvement. Please add more cool ideas. :)

Thank you!

p.s. It feels strange to share notebooks with Kaggle after a long time.
