And this applies to most Kaggle competitions, because in most cases, you need to do a lot of experiment cycles.  \n\nIn fact, I've been participating for about three years using a CPU-only laptop and a cheap cloud service like Colab, but I've only managed to get a silver medal. I bought an RTX 4090 a few months ago and was able to get a gold medal right away, which gives me an advantage in this competition too.  \n\n",

                    "content": "Note that renting a GPU starts (in Germany) around 50 cent / hour - let's say a training takes 8 hours, thats 4â‚¬. You will do some iterations, so you will definetly spent more money, BUT a 4090 is about 1800â‚¬ in Germany - so you can do about 450 trainings (or 3600 hours of training!!) on a rented GPU. If you want to try something before doing such a heavy investment, you could start like that.\n\nFurther, since Kaggle provides you 30 GB of VRAM (vs. about 23 GB on a Windows PC with a 4090), you can try all the things before going into investment. The big blocker with kaggle GPUs is speed, not possibilities.\n\n",
