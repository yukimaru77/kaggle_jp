# Accessing Llama 3 MODEL_NAME in inference notebook

Hi. I have successfully run the amazing [TPU Llama 3 training notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kishanvavdara/lmsys-llama-3-tpu-train) by [@kishanvavdara](https://www.kaggle.com/kishanvavdara) and now I am trying to run the inference notebook. I have already been given access to the Llama 3 usage both on hugging face and meta official page and I have the corresponding hugging face token as well and weights file as well. When I try to run the [inference notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kishanvavdara/inference-llama-3-8b), i get the below error 

OSError: Incorrect path_or_model_id: '/kaggle/input/llama-3/transformers/8b-chat-hf/1'. Please provide either the path to a local folder or the repo_id of a model on the Hub.

Internet access is off in the inference notebook. So I cannot use MODEL_NAME="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct" like I did in training notebook which downloads the model from scratch from hugging face hub. Any sort of help would be highly appreciated. [@valentinwerner](https://www.kaggle.com/valentinwerner)

> First, you also need to request Llama Access on Kaggle, you can do so by following the model link. Then, make sure you have the llama model added as model in the notebook, then the path will be exactly right.
