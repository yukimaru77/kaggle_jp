        "content": "Hey folks ‚Äì Today, we‚Äôre releasing a free dataset explorer for the LMSYS challenge.\n\nWith our tool, you can browse through individual rows and inspect their content in great detail. We generated semantic clusters, and you can filter conversations by cluster, model pairs, winner model, and so on.\n\nThe tool is free and no login is required. Be sure to let the community know what you discover.\n\nClick this link to start exploring: [https://app.airtrain.ai/dataset/bb589c26-8f45-4f42-8ba3-07ef51b73a03/null/1/0](https://app.airtrain.ai/dataset/bb589c26-8f45-4f42-8ba3-07ef51b73a03/null/1/0)\n\n",

I am not sure if you are allowed to publish data from the competition on your platform, given the cc-by-nc license. I know that there was the recommendation not to do such in previous conpetitions.\n\nMaybe you can instead show us how to use your tool to create such a dashboard instead?\n\nAll the best for your company and product!\n\n(Also quite the PR stunt to have your employees comment on your thread (Josh & Idriss) üòâ)\n\n",
