# Data Annotation Intuition - why the labels are noisy

I see that there are several ongoing discussions regarding label quality. As someone, who has spent a significant amount of time annotating data (and asking other people to annotate data for me), I want to share an opinion and intution of mine too.

In Data Annotation, you generally want professionals to annotate the data. They are supposed to (but sometimes do not do so) read the data carefully, select the labels carefully etc.; the annotated data is considered the GROUND TRUTH as these experts should be able to objectively decide the correct label (given same understand of the problem and annotation task). 

Then you generally compute an Inter-Annotator Agreement (are n people giving the same label on the same text), which was often seen as a ceiling for performance. Although this is not always the case in reality, this makes sense, because that means that your model is able to learn the intersection of knowledge from multiple annotators. 

Why is this important? The data we are training on is annotated by random people who wanted to try LLMs. While LMSYS is a great tool that I often use and recommend, it is for our problem mostly an annotation tool where the annotator can decide what question they want to annotate for and the data to annotate is generated in real time. 

However, there are several issues with this for our challenge:

- Users are not experts in using or understanding LLMs

- Users are often not experts in the topic they are asking about (and are often not fact-checking the responses)

- Unless users specify the same prompt and receive the same response, there is no way to evaluate Inter-Annotator Agreement

- LMSYS does not allow to undo or redo annotations (e.g., misclicked the wrong side)

- And most importantly: users have different preferences. This annotation task is not objective at all but PURELY subjective

This means we have NOISY labels and should employ techniques to deal with this; there are techniques such as active learning, ensembling, changing loss etc. which might work to address this issue - all of this needs to be tested (although ensembling is something we will do anyways ðŸ˜‰).
