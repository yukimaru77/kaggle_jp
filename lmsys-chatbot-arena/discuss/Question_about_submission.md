# Question about submission

**Stanislav9801** *Thu Jul 18 2024 05:44:16 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)* (0 votes)

When creating submission, do my notebook should take as input test.csv file and produce output.csv file?

I mean, when I submit notebook, does test data will be loaded there dynamically, and through notebook inference submission.csv file should be produced? And this test.csv will not be the same as test.csv in the data provided?

So in this case my notebook should behave as a function, which takes test.csv as input, and submission.csv as output? Am I right?

This is my first time submission, so I don't understand this process a bit.

Thanks.
