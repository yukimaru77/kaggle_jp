# Gemma2 9b's inference time is much longer that Llama3 8b?

With same submission code, my Llama3 8b model takes ~4h to finish the inference, but my Gemma2 9b takes ~8h. Are you experiencing the same?

If you are using bfloat16 in compute, it will be MUCH slower since T4 does not support bfloat16, and need to emulate it by other methods. In my experience, Gemma2 9b and Mistral 7b inference time does not have much a difference (3~4h range), provides using 4bit weights and float16 dtype.
