        "content": "The competition is coming to an end. As a novice, this is my first time playing Kaggle. I encountered many problems and learned a lot. I was constantly fine-tuning the model before, but I had never enhanced the data. Today, I have realized all my ideas about fine-tuning the model. I have started a new exploration on how to get a higher score. I have learned some knowledge about data enhancement, including back-translation method and EDA method, and I am ready to use EDA for the next attempt. At the same time, I wonder if you have other methods you are willing to share.\n\n[https://www.cnblogs.com/IllidanStormrage/p/16347433.html](https://www.cnblogs.com/IllidanStormrage/p/16347433.html)\n\n",

Using external data didn't improve the score for anyone as far as I can remember from the discussions, but I'll be curious to see if it works. \n\n",
