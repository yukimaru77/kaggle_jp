        "content": "Hi, I am new to Kaggle and I am wondering if we can have access to the outputs of the notebooks we submitted for scoring (probably not?) If we couldn't access the submission logs, then how can we know how long our notebooks run? I have seen people discussing about the runtime of the notebook and I would really appreciate someone can explain how you measure the runtime of your solution on test set.\n\nThank you all! Best of luck for everyone in the coming 2 weeks!\n\n",
