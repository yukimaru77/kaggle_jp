# 7b OOM while 8b works fine, is this strange?

I am trying to compare the performance of different base models, for example we can compare base mistral 7B model quantized to 8bit and compare this to the llama 3 8B model also quantized to 8bit. I am noticing I get OOM errors for the 7B model (and others) but not the llama3 8b? I understand they can have different architectures with different memory requirements and that their size is not fully dependent on the number of parameters but just to be sure does anyone else find this strange?

From what I can see they also have the same hidden sizes and dimensions, so embeddings for Mistral should not take more RAM than for Llama
