        "content": "Here, the provided code defines several functions to compute various text analysis metrics to understand the quality of the prompt and responses. The functions are defined to calculate word count, character count, sentence count, average word length, average sentence length, type-token ratio, word frequency, bigram frequency, and readability scores using the nltk and textstat libraries. \n\nThe readability scores function calculates several readability indices, including the Flesch-Kincaid score, Gunning Fog index, SMOG index, and Automated Readability Index (ARI).\n\nAfter defining these functions, the code applies them to the \"prompt\", \"response_a\", and \"response_b\" columns of the DataFrame. For each of these columns, it calculates the word count, character count, sentence count, average word length, and average sentence length by applying the respective functions and creates new columns in the DataFrame to store these metrics. \n\nHere, in the notebook  I have just tried a few of these metrics to achieve a log loss of 1.05.\n\nWays you can enhance this code to decrease it's log loss:\n\nAdd more hyperparameters.\nTry out the other metrics (which are commented on in the code).\nAlso, add more variables like the Jaccard index and cosine similarity between response a, b, and prompt.\nIncrease the number of iterations for each model per fold.\n\nThese can easily improve the model output and decrease the log loss on the test dataset.\n\nAlso, upload the textstat library as the internet is turned off for this competition.\n\nNotebook URL: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/nehalroy/using-xgboost-and-gb-using-nltk](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nehalroy/using-xgboost-and-gb-using-nltk)\n\n",
