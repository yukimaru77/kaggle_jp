        "content": "How are we gonna predict the probability when we have no training data with probabilities that makes sense. The training data is comprised of 1-hot vectors assigning 100% probability to one of the outcomes. That must clearly be wrong. I don't understand what the training set represents. Does it represent the preference of one particular human? Of a random human? If so, are there multiple rows with the same prompt and responses for different people?\n\n",

In each user interaction a judge provides one or more prompts to two different large language models, and then indicates which of the models gave the more satisfactory response.\"\n\nSo i guess we have to like do a softmax on the logits to get probabilities.\n\n",
