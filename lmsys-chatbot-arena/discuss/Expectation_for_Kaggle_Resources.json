        "content": "Hi all, my team as well as what seems like others seem to be struggling with submission times. Even submissions that we ran in 6 hours before are now timing out? We have significantly raised our CV in the last few days but have been entirely unable to get results for it due to this compute issue. I was hoping some of the Kaggle staff could help speak to what is going on? I am familiar that close to the end of competitions in the last 2 or 3 days things run a bit slower but we are experiencing 2 times longer inference time than 4 days ago and have been ever since 7 days to go! It would be a shame to put in all this work over the last several months and not get to benefit from putting it all together. \n\n",

Eventhough this wastes a submission, if you have time for it, try the old notebook and version again.\n\nTo me it does not seem reasonable that participation rates raise GPU Processing times. It is not like we are all on the same two T4s. Also all the environments are containers, so they should be clean on every run.\n\n",

This also goes for room temperature at servers etc. \n\nThe point, I am making about containerization is that when you submission is over you have a clean GPU, its not like you will share compute etc. - However, you can and will get worse chips. Its impossible for the kaggle team to have all GPUs available perform exactly the same. \n\n",
