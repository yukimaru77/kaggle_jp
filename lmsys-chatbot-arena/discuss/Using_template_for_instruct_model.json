        "content": "I heard that using instruct model would perform slightly better. But when I was using Llama-8b and Llama-8b-instruct without template,  they got the same LB score.\n\nDoes the template matters? I had tried using template but the score was even worse. Also, I found that using a template causes the logloss stuckâ€¦\n\nSome details:\n\n1 epoch\n\n4 batch size * 2 accumulation_steps\n\nand just trying different lora params ðŸ¤¡\n\nAny thoughts or insights on this?\n\n",
