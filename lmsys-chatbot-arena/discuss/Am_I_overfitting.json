            "content": "Overfitting is best analyzed in combination with validation loss. If you validation loss has a similar drop to your training loss (which I guess would win the competition at these scores), you are not overfitting. In general, if training loss goes down while validation loss is either plateauing or going back up, you are likely overfitting.\n\nAnother way of estimating overfitting is to look at what performance you expect and what you see on the train loss. We would not expect the model to go to .800 or even below it - therefore, it is likely to overfit. However, this does not mean that the model was best before this downward shift at steps 550 - you should use a validation score to evaluate how well the model predicts on unseen data\n\n",

If the loss on the validation set is large, but very low on the training set, it is overfitting, and you can consider adding regularization such as weight decay. If the loss on both the validation set and the training set is low, it means the model is effective.\n\n",
