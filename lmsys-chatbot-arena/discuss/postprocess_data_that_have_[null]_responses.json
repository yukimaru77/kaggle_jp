However, the score got worse a little bit. Has anyone had the same experience?\n\n",

On the 57k training samples, 19 samples fit into this pattern according to the post you link. Assuming same distribution in the dataset you are doing postprocessing for 10 samples. And 2-3 of which would be in the public lb.\n\nAs the 19 samples in the training set are not a representative sample size to start with, it is quite likely that you should just \"trust your model\". \n\n",

The null data in the test dataset, which you estimated to be only 2-3 affecting the public leaderboard, is just too small.\n\nIn this case, it might be ineffective to assume the same distribution based on these few samples.\n\n",
