# Chatbot Arena's Rules

It has been noticed that the train set consists of conversations rather than single prompts and responses. ([https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lmsys-chatbot-arena/discussion/500633)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lmsys-chatbot-arena/discussion/500633)).

These are the rules of the chatbot arena ( [https://chat.lmsys.org/](https://chat.lmsys.org/) ) :

- Ask any question to two anonymous models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Llama) and vote for the better one!

- You can chat for multiple turns until you identify a winner.

- Votes won't be counted if model identities are revealed during the conversation.

As a rough approximation, you might think that the last question has a winner while all the previous ones are ties.

Hope this helps!

But don't you think that the responses generated in between also preserve important information since if a human makes the final selection, he/she will also consider the thinking process of LLM? Since reaching the right answer with unexplainable thinking itself will result in less credibility of the model.
