# Download Llama3 Models from Kaggle?

Is there a way for me to download the Llama3 Models that were trained by others from Kaggle? I am talking about the model that is used in all the top scoring public notebooks. When I click on the dataset, I only see a placeholder file with about 30 MB of data.
