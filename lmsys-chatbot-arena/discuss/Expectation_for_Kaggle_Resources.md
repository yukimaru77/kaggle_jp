# Expectation for Kaggle Resources?

Hi all, my team as well as what seems like others seem to be struggling with submission times. Even submissions that we ran in 6 hours before are now timing out? We have significantly raised our CV in the last few days but have been entirely unable to get results for it due to this compute issue. I was hoping some of the Kaggle staff could help speak to what is going on? I am familiar that close to the end of competitions in the last 2 or 3 days things run a bit slower but we are experiencing 2 times longer inference time than 4 days ago and have been ever since 7 days to go! It would be a shame to put in all this work over the last several months and not get to benefit from putting it all together.
