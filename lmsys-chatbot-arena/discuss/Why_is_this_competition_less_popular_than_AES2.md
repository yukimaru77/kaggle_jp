# Why is this competition less popular than AES2?

Sorry I am new so it is not obvious to me. 

AES2 had 2700 participants, this one probably will not reach more than 2000 at the end.

Is it due to summer holidays?

Or maybe competition requiring  a stronger compute?

The topic certainly does not seem niche, maybe even less niche than AES2?

I am not aware of any organizational mistakes?

Maybe all my assumptions are wrong, I would like to hear your thoughts.
