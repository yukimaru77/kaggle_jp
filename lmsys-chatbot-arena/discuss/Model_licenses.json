I can see that different models come with different licenses: [https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/repositories-licenses](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/repositories-licenses). How can I find out which licenses conform to the competition rules?\n\nThanks.\n\n",

From my understanding (not a lawyer) you should not submit this to the competition (because then it becomes an attempt to win money). However, as long as you dont go for a gold medal, it probably hardly matters.\n\n",
