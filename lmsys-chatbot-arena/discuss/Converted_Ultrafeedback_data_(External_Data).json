This means that the model with the higher rating is the winner and the tie is the \"tie\".\n\nPlease see that:\n\nConvert Code: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/takamichitoda/lmsys-convert-ultrafeedback-to-competition](https://www.kaggle.com/code/takamichitoda/lmsys-convert-ultrafeedback-to-competition)\n\nDataset: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/takamichitoda/lmsys-ultrafeedback](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/takamichitoda/lmsys-ultrafeedback)\n\nI would like to thank [@thedrcat](https://www.kaggle.com/thedrcat) for initially sharing this data.\n\nPlease make sure to upvote the [original discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lmsys-chatbot-arena/discussion/499756).\n\n",
