This competition was launched on May 2nd, and phi3 was released on April 23rd under the MIT license. So, could you [@sohier](https://www.kaggle.com/sohier) [@paultimothymooney](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney) please confirm if we can use that model? \n\n",

I will note, however, that the only competition with a specified date relating to model releases is the AIMO competition, and that rule does not apply to other competitions.\n\n",
