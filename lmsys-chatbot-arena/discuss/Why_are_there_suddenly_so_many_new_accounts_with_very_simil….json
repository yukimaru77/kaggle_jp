However, what will happen next is 5 Notebooks that Ensemble these to get .940, .939, â€¦ without any novel ideas\n\nThis is not the kaggle way in my opinion.\n\nI think it is great that this approach was shared because I read a lot of people are struggling with GPU resources to get something to work, the notebook that was shared just \"works a little too well\"\n\n",
