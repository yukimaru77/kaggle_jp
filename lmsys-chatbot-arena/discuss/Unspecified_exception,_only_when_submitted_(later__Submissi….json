Both the R and Python notebooks are failing with a Submission Scoring Error after minor modifications. I see that the row sums of the probabilities are not always exactly 1 (e.g., 1.002, 0.999, 1.000). If that could be the problem, could you please see if you can comment on what might repair that problem? I have tried various kinds of rounding and standardizing as you will see in code. Thank you!\n\nR:           [https://www.kaggle.com/code/rickpack/r-average-prob-per-word-no-gpu?scriptVersionId=179034682](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rickpack/r-average-prob-per-word-no-gpu?scriptVersionId=179034682)\n\nPython:  [https://www.kaggle.com/code/rickpack/python-average-prob-per-word-no-gpu?scriptVersionId=179035436](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rickpack/python-average-prob-per-word-no-gpu?scriptVersionId=179035436)\n\n",

                    "content": "[@rickpack](https://www.kaggle.com/rickpack) , I think that the reason that the issue of row sum of the probabilities suggested that you may have a normalization issue. Also different scores of R and python may suggest that they handle the data differently. I mean, even if the same statistical methods or the same algorithm, their implementation in r and Python libraries can differ in terms of numerical precision or optimizations. \n\n",
