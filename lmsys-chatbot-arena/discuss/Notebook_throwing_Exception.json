            "content": "This is just one potential issue, but how are you handling the \"null\" that sometimes occur? Doing this helped for me in the early submissions: response.replace(\"null\",\"'null'\") <-- note the extra ' to make it a string before loading the string representation of the list an actual list (e.g., with ast.literal_eval(response))\n\nI really hope this is doing it for you - because these exceptions can be nasty. If not, maybe try debugging by predicting on training data again.\n\nIf the GPU goes OOM its not an OOM error on kaggle but an Exception, so maybe reduce batch size or max length too. Best of luck!\n\n",
