        "content": "I'm not sure how this guy managed to quickly move from LB: 880 to LB: 707, and then to LB: 663. I suspect his training plan is similar to those of other teams in the gold tier, but the training data might be very different!\n\nAdditionally, in a discussion thread titled “Suspicious Surge of Novice Accounts on the Leaderboard,” I initially thought these \"newcomers\" wouldn’t affect the Top 100, but this morning when I checked the leaderboard, I found myself around 80th place. I admit my guess was wrong.\n\nLastly, my teammates and I are discussing whether to make our training and inference solutions public today or tomorrow in order to counter these \"potentially cheating newcomers.\"\n\n",
