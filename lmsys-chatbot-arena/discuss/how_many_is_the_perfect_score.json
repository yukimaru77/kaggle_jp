            "content": "The metric \"log_loss\" allows for a score of 0.0 (e.g., exactly perfect predictions every time). An \"educated guess\" score (predicting the distribution of the train set) gets you a score of about 1.097.\n\nThe problem is that human preferences, which we are trying to predict, are not clearly predictable. This is because if we both write a prompt, we may prefer different responses - so how is our model supposed to learn which responses are better. Because the problem is this hard to predict, the \"ceiling\" of the score is much higher than 0.0 - more along the lines of 0.75 or 0.8 (just a gut feeling)\n\n",
