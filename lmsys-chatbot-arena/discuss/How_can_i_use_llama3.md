# How can i use llama3?

**zyw** *Tue May 28 2024 03:11:29 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)* (1 votes)

I submitted the llama3 form without applying from the meta official website, and the model author refused me to use llama3. 

After I clicked "here" and filled out the form on the meta official website, I can now use llama2 normally, but cannot use llama3. I want to resubmit the form but I don't find the submit button. Can anyone help me solve this problem?
