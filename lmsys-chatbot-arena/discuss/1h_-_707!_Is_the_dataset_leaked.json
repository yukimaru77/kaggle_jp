Even ignoring all remarks on speed of submission, I dont think a model that could run inference in an hour (likely the size of deberta Base or smaller), is even  able to overfit this hard on a problem this complex. \n\nNot going to lie, I would love him to have come up with some insane solution.\n\n",
