            "content": "There are several things you can do, and what is often done:\n\n1) You can download the models, save them as kaggle dataset, load them from kaggle dataset instead (same goes for pip installs you might want to do)\n\n2) You can train models in one notebook with internet access, save the model checkpoint at the end and then create a separate notebook without internet access. Then you can simply add the training notebook as input for the inference notebook!\n\nHope this helps, welcome to kaggle and good luck!\n\n",

Ensure your submission does not include any code that requires internet access, such as downloading data from external URLs or accessing online APIs.\n\nOtherwise no issue. \n\n",
