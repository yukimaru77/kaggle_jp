The Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any participant who uses the Competition Data other than as permitted by the Competition Website and these Rules.

The Competition Data is also subject to the following terms and conditions: [CC BY-NC 4.0 (AttributionNonCommercial 4.0 International)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). To the extent that the terms and conditions located at the URL conflict with or are inconsistent with these Rules, these Rules will govern your use of the Competition Data.

You agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Competition Data to any party not participating in the Competition. You agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission of or unauthorized access to the Competition Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission or access.

C. External Data. You may use data other than the Competition Data (“External Data”) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is publicly available and equally accessible to use by all participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other participants. The ability to use External Data under this Section 7.C (External Data) does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 11 (Winners Obligations). 

#### 8.    SUBMISSION CODE REQUIREMENTS.

A. Private Code Sharing. Unless otherwise specifically permitted under the Competition Website or Competition Specific Rules above, during the Competition Period, you are not allowed to privately share source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Competition Data or other source or executable code relevant to the Competition (“Competition Code”). This prohibition includes sharing Competition Code between separate Teams, unless a Team merger occurs. Any such sharing of Competition Code is a breach of these Competition Rules and may result in disqualification.

B. Public Code Sharing. You are permitted to publicly share Competition Code, provided that such public sharing does not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. If you do choose to share Competition Code or other such code, you are required to share it on Kaggle.com on the discussion forum or notebooks associated specifically with the Competition for the benefit of all competitors. By so sharing, you are deemed to have licensed the shared code under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org)) that in no event limits commercial use of such Competition Code or model containing or depending on such Competition Code.

C. Use of Open Source. Unless otherwise stated in the Specific Competition Rules above, if open source code is used in the model to generate the Submission, then you must only use open source code licensed under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org)) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.

#### 9.    DETERMINING WINNERS. 

Each Submission will be scored and ranked by the evaluation metric stated on the Competition Website. During the Competition Period, the current ranking will be visible on the Competition Website's public leaderboard. The potential winner(s) are determined solely by the leaderboard ranking on the private leaderboard, subject to compliance with these Rules. The public leaderboard will be based on the public test set and the private leaderboard will be based on the private test set.

In the event of a tie, the Submission that was entered first to the Competition will be the winner. In the event a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the Submission that received the next highest score rank will be chosen as the potential winner.

#### 10.    NOTIFICATION OF WINNERS & DISQUALIFICATION.

The potential winner(s) will be notified by email. 

If a potential winner (i) does not respond to the notification attempt within one (1) week from the first notification attempt or (ii) notifies Kaggle within one week after the Final Submission Deadline that the potential winner does not want to be nominated as a winner or does not want to receive a Prize, then, in each case (i) and (ii) such potential winner will not receive any Prize, and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the Competition’s judging criteria.

In case (i) and (ii) above Kaggle may disqualify the participant.  However, in case (ii) above, if requested by Kaggle, such potential winner may provide code and documentation to verify the participant’s compliance with these Rules. If the potential winner provides code and documentation to the satisfaction of Kaggle, the participant will not be disqualified pursuant to this paragraph.

Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any participant from the Competition if the Competition Sponsor reasonably believes that the participant has attempted to undermine the legitimate operation of the Competition by cheating, deception, or other unfair playing practices or abuses, threatens or harasses any other participants, Competition Sponsor or Kaggle.

A disqualified participant may be removed from the Competition leaderboard, at Kaggle's sole discretion. If a Participant is removed from the Competition Leaderboard, additional winning features associated with the Kaggle competition platform, for example Kaggle points or medals, may also not be awarded.

The final leaderboard list will be publicly displayed at Kaggle.com. Determinations of Competition Sponsor are final and binding.

#### 11.    WINNERS OBLIGATIONS.

As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:

(a) deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow [these documentation guidelines](https://www.kaggle.com/WinningModelDocumentationGuidelines), must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully.  For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment. To the extent that the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission;

(b) grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license; 

(c) sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (i) eligibility certifications; (ii) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (iii) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).

#### 12.    PRIZES. 

Prize(s) are as described on the Competition Website and are only available for winning during the time period described on the Competition Website. The odds of winning any Prize depends on the number of eligible Submissions received during the Competition Period and the skill of the participants. 

All Prizes are subject to Competition Sponsor's review and verification of the participant’s eligibility and compliance with these Rules, and the compliance of the winning Submissions with the Submissions Requirements. In the event that the Submission demonstrates non-compliance with these Competition Rules, Competition Sponsor may at its discretion take either of the following actions: (i) disqualify the Submission(s); or (ii) require the potential winner to remediate within one week after notice all issues identified in the Submission(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution of license conflicts, the fulfillment of all obligations required by software licenses, and the removal of any software that violates the software restrictions).

A potential winner may decline to be nominated as a Competition winner in accordance with Section 10.

Potential winners must return all required Prize acceptance documents within two (2) weeks following notification of such required documents, or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected. Prize(s) will be awarded within approximately 30 days after receipt by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle of the required Prize acceptance documents. Transfer or assignment of a Prize is not allowed. 

You are not eligible to receive any Prize if you do not meet the Eligibility requirements in Section 2 above. 

If a Team wins a monetary Prize, the Prize money will be allocated in even shares between the eligible Team members, unless the Team unanimously opts for a different Prize split and notifies Kaggle before Prizes are issued.

#### 13.    TAXES.

ALL TAXES IMPOSED ON PRIZES ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WINNERS. Payments to potential winners are subject to the express requirement that they submit all documentation requested by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle for compliance with applicable state, federal, local and foreign (including provincial) tax reporting and withholding requirements. Prizes will be net of any taxes that Competition Sponsor is required by law to withhold. If a potential winner fails to provide any required documentation or comply with applicable laws, the Prize may be forfeited and Competition Sponsor may select an alternative potential winner. Any winners who are U.S. residents will receive an IRS Form-1099 in the amount of their Prize.

#### 14.    GENERAL CONDITIONS.  

All federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations apply.

#### 8.    SUBMISSION CODE REQUIREMENTS.

A. Private Code Sharing. Unless otherwise specifically permitted under the Competition Website or Competition Specific Rules above, during the Competition Period, you are not allowed to privately share source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Competition Data or other source or executable code relevant to the Competition (“Competition Code”).

Any such sharing of Competition Code is a breach of these Competition Rules and may result in disqualification.

B. Public Code Sharing. You are permitted to publicly share Competition Code, provided that such public sharing does not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. If you do choose to share Competition Code or other such code, you are required to share it on Kaggle.com on the discussion forum or notebooks associated specifically with the Competition for the benefit of all competitors. By so sharing, you are deemed to have licensed the shared code under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org)) that in no event limits commercial use of such Competition Code or model containing or depending on such Competition Code.

C. Use of Open Source. Unless otherwise stated in the Specific Competition Rules above, if open source code is used in the model to generate the Submission, then you must only use open source code licensed under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org)) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.

#### 9.    DETERMINING WINNERS. 

Each Submission will be scored and ranked by the evaluation metric stated on the Competition Website. During the Competition Period, the current ranking will be visible on the Competition Website's public leaderboard. The potential winner(s) are determined solely by the leaderboard ranking on the private leaderboard, subject to compliance with these Rules. The public leaderboard will be based on the public test set and the private leaderboard will be based on the private test set.

In the event of a tie, the Submission that was entered first to the Competition will be the winner. In the event a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the Submission that received the next highest score rank will be chosen as the potential winner.

#### 10.    NOTIFICATION OF WINNERS & DISQUALIFICATION.

The potential winner(s) will be notified by email. 

If a potential winner (i) does not respond to the notification attempt within one (1) week from the first notification attempt or (ii) notifies Kaggle within one week after the Final Submission Deadline that the potential winner does not want to be nominated as a winner or does not want to receive a Prize, then, in each case (i) and (ii) such potential winner will not receive any Prize, and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the Competition’s judging criteria.

In case (i) and (ii) above Kaggle may disqualify the participant.  However, in case (ii) above, if requested by Kaggle, such potential winner may provide code and documentation to verify the participant’s compliance with these Rules. If the potential winner provides code and documentation to the satisfaction of Kaggle, the participant will not be disqualified pursuant to this paragraph.

Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any participant from the Competition if the Competition Sponsor reasonably believes that the participant has attempted to undermine the legitimate operation of the Competition by cheating, deception, or other unfair playing practices or abuses, threatens or harasses any other participants, Competition Sponsor or Kaggle.

A disqualified participant may be removed from the Competition leaderboard, at Kaggle's sole discretion. If a Participant is removed from the Competition Leaderboard, additional winning features associated with the Kaggle competition platform, for example Kaggle points or medals, may also not be awarded.

The final leaderboard list will be publicly displayed at Kaggle.com. Determinations of Competition Sponsor are final and binding.

#### 11.    WINNERS OBLIGATIONS.

As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:

(a) deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow [these documentation guidelines](https://www.kaggle.com/WinningModelDocumentationGuidelines), must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully.  For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment. To the extent that the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission;

(b) grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license; 

(c) sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (i) eligibility certifications; (ii) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (iii) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).

#### 12.    PRIZES. 

Prize(s) are as described on the Competition Website and are only available for winning during the time period described on the Competition Website. The odds of winning any Prize depends on the number of eligible Submissions received during the Competition Period and the skill of the participants. 

All Prizes are subject to Competition Sponsor's review and verification of the participant’s eligibility and compliance with these Rules, and the compliance of the winning Submissions with the Submissions Requirements. In the event that the Submission demonstrates non-compliance with these Competition Rules, Competition Sponsor may at its discretion take either of the following actions: (i) disqualify the Submission(s); or (ii) require the potential winner to remediate within one week after notice all issues identified in the Submission(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution of license conflicts, the fulfillment of all obligations required by software licenses, and the removal of any software that violates the software restrictions).

A potential winner may decline to be nominated as a Competition winner in accordance with Section 10.

Potential winners must return all required Prize acceptance documents within two (2) weeks following notification of such required documents, or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected. Prize(s) will be awarded within approximately 30 days after receipt by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle of the required Prize acceptance documents. Transfer or assignment of a Prize is not allowed. 

You are not eligible to receive any Prize if you do not meet the Eligibility requirements in Section 2 above. 

If a Team wins a monetary Prize, the Prize money will be allocated in even shares between the eligible Team members, unless the Team unanimously opts for a different Prize split and notifies Kaggle before Prizes are issued.

#### 13.    TAXES.

ALL TAXES IMPOSED ON PRIZES ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WINNERS. Payments to potential winners are subject to the express requirement that they submit all documentation requested by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle for compliance with applicable state, federal, local and foreign (including provincial) tax reporting and withholding requirements. Prizes will be net of any taxes that Competition Sponsor is required by law to withhold. If a potential winner fails to provide any required documentation or comply with applicable laws, the Prize may be forfeited and Competition Sponsor may select an alternative potential winner. Any winners who are U.S. residents will receive an IRS Form-1099 in the amount of their Prize.

#### 1. WINNER LICENSE.

Under Section 11 (Winners Obligations) of the General Rules below, you hereby grant and will grant Competition Sponsor the following license(s) with respect to your Submission if you are a Competition winner:

Open Source: You hereby license and will license your winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission under CC BY 4.0 that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.

However, you will ensure the External Data is publicly available and equally accessible to use by all participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other participants. The ability to use External Data under this Section 7.C (External Data) does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 11 (Winners Obligations). 

#### 8.    SUBMISSION CODE REQUIREMENTS.

A. Private Code Sharing. Unless otherwise specifically permitted under the Competition Website or Competition Specific Rules above, during the Competition Period, you are not allowed to privately share source or executable code developed in connection with or based upon the Competition Data or other source or executable code relevant to the Competition (“Competition Code”).

B. Public Code Sharing. You are permitted to publicly share Competition Code, provided that such public sharing does not violate the intellectual property rights of any third party. If you do choose to share Competition Code or other such code, you are required to share it on Kaggle.com on the discussion forum or notebooks associated specifically with the Competition for the benefit of all competitors. By so sharing, you are deemed to have licensed the shared code under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org)) that in no event limits commercial use of such Competition Code or model containing or depending on such Competition Code.

C. Use of Open Source. Unless otherwise stated in the Specific Competition Rules above, if open source code is used in the model to generate the Submission, then you must only use open source code licensed under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org](http://www.opensource.org)) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.

#### 9.    DETERMINING WINNERS. 

Each Submission will be scored and ranked by the evaluation metric stated on the Competition Website. During the Competition Period, the current ranking will be visible on the Competition Website's public leaderboard. The potential winner(s) are determined solely by the leaderboard ranking on the private leaderboard, subject to compliance with these Rules. The public leaderboard will be based on the public test set and the private leaderboard will be based on the private test set.

In the event of a tie, the Submission that was entered first to the Competition will be the winner. In the event a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the Submission that received the next highest score rank will be chosen as the potential winner.

#### 10.    NOTIFICATION OF WINNERS & DISQUALIFICATION.

The potential winner(s) will be notified by email. 

If a potential winner (i) does not respond to the notification attempt within one (1) week from the first notification attempt or (ii) notifies Kaggle within one week after the Final Submission Deadline that the potential winner does not want to be nominated as a winner or does not want to receive a Prize, then, in each case (i) and (ii) such potential winner will not receive any Prize, and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the Competition’s judging criteria.

In case (i) and (ii) above Kaggle may disqualify the participant.  However, in case (ii) above, if requested by Kaggle, such potential winner may provide code and documentation to verify the participant’s compliance with these Rules. If the potential winner provides code and documentation to the satisfaction of Kaggle, the participant will not be disqualified pursuant to this paragraph.

Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any participant from the Competition if the Competition Sponsor reasonably believes that the participant has attempted to undermine the legitimate operation of the Competition by cheating, deception, or other unfair playing practices or abuses, threatens or harasses any other participants, Competition Sponsor or Kaggle.

A disqualified participant may be removed from the Competition leaderboard, at Kaggle's sole discretion. If a Participant is removed from the Competition Leaderboard, additional winning features associated with the Kaggle competition platform, for example Kaggle points or medals, may also not be awarded.

The final leaderboard list will be publicly displayed at Kaggle.com. Determinations of Competition Sponsor are final and binding.

#### 11.    WINNERS OBLIGATIONS.

As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:

(a) deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow [these documentation guidelines](https://www.kaggle.com/WinningModelDocumentationGuidelines), must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully.  For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment. To the extent that the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission;

(b) grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license; 

(c) sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (i) eligibility certifications; (ii) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (iii) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).

#### 12.    PRIZES. 

Prize(s) are as described on the Competition Website and are only available for winning during the time period described on the Competition Website. The odds of winning any Prize depends on the number of eligible Submissions received during the Competition Period and the skill of the participants. 

All Prizes are subject to Competition Sponsor's review and verification of the participant’s eligibility and compliance with these Rules, and the compliance of the winning Submissions with the Submissions Requirements. In the event that the Submission demonstrates non-compliance with these Competition Rules, Competition Sponsor may at its discretion take either of the following actions: (i) disqualify the Submission(s); or (ii) require the potential winner to remediate within one week after notice all issues identified in the Submission(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution of license conflicts, the fulfillment of all obligations required by software licenses, and the removal of any software that violates the software restrictions).

A potential winner may decline to be nominated as a Competition winner in accordance with Section 10.

Potential winners must return all required Prize acceptance documents within two (2) weeks following notification of such required documents, or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected. Prize(s) will be awarded within approximately 30 days after receipt by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle of the required Prize acceptance documents. Transfer or assignment of a Prize is not allowed. 

You are not eligible to receive any Prize if you do not meet the Eligibility requirements in Section 2 above. 

If a Team wins a monetary Prize, the Prize money will be allocated in even shares between the eligible Team members, unless the Team unanimously opts for a different Prize split and notifies Kaggle before Prizes are issued.

#### 13.    TAXES.

ALL TAXES IMPOSED ON PRIZES ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WINNERS. Payments to potential winners are subject to the express requirement that they submit all documentation requested by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle for compliance with applicable state, federal, local and foreign (including provincial) tax reporting and withholding requirements. Prizes will be net of any taxes that Competition Sponsor is required by law to withhold. If a potential winner fails to provide any required documentation or comply with applicable laws, the Prize may be forfeited and Competition Sponsor may select an alternative potential winner. Any winners who are U.S. residents will receive an IRS Form-1099 in the amount of their Prize.
