> Hi! Good notebook. When trying to load llama 3 model I got this error >OSError: Incorrect path_or_model_id: '/kaggle/input/llama-3/transformers/8b-chat-hf/1'. Please provide either the path to a local folder or the repo_id of a model on the Hub. How can I fix that? I didn't change any bit of code.
