I did get the pull command to work after following the link to upgrade my Kaggle notebook to a google notebook and in the process creating a pay tier gcloud account (without spending any money on Google).  Google may require you to associate your gcloud account with a payment method (apart from your general gsuite payment method) in order for your account login to pass cli authentication to work for the docker pull\n\n",
