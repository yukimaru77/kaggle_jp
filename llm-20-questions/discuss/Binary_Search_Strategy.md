# Binary Search Strategy

Is there a team that is pursuing binary search strategy to eliminate half the possibilities each time? It would require a lot of tokens in the question. 

I would like to join that team. I’m a teacher, and only a code dabbler but I like that strategy from playing “guess who.”
