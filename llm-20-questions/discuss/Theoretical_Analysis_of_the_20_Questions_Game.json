In this post, I will explain how to calculate the winning probability for each round and present the results plotted for different reduction factors.\n\n### Background\n\nThe 20 Questions game involves identifying a keyword through Yes/No questions. To calculate the theoretical winning probability, we assume the following conditions:\n\nThe number of candidates decreases by a certain factor after each question.\nThe game consists of 20 rounds, and the keyword can be guessed in each round.\n\n### Formulas and Calculation Method\n\nLet N be the initial number of keywords, and reduction_factor be the ratio by which the number of candidates decreases in each round.\n\nThe number of candidates Nk in round k is given by:\n\n```\nNk = N * (reduction_factor ^ k)\n\n```\n\nThe winning probability Pk in round k is calculated as:\n\n```\nPk = (1 - sum(Pi for i in range(1, k))) * (1 / Nk)\n\n```\n\nThe cumulative winning probability Ck is:\n\n```\nCk = sum(Pi for i in range(1, k+1))\n\n```\n\n### Calculation and Plotting with Python Code\n\nThe following Python code calculates the cumulative winning probability for each round in the 20 Questions game and plots the results for different reduction factors.\n\n```\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef calculate_win_probabilities(N: int, rounds: int, reduction_factor: float) -> list[float]:\n    cumulative_probabilities = []\n    previous_prob = 0\n\n    for k in range(1, rounds + 1):\n        Nk = N * (reduction_factor ** k)\n        current_prob = (1 - previous_prob) * (1 / Nk)\n        previous_prob += current_prob\n        if previous_prob > 1:\n            previous_prob = 1  # Ensure the winning probability does not exceed 1\n        cumulative_probabilities.append(previous_prob)\n\n    return cumulative_probabilities\n\ndef plot_cumulative_probabilities(probabilities_dict: dict[float, list[float]]):\n    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))\n\n    for reduction_factor, probabilities in probabilities_dict.items():\n        rounds = range(1, len(probabilities) + 1)\n        plt.plot(rounds, probabilities, marker='o', linestyle='-', label=f'Reduction Factor = {reduction_factor}')\n\n    plt.xlabel('Round')\n    plt.ylabel('Cumulative Probability of Winning')\n    plt.title('Cumulative Probability of Winning per Round for Different Reduction Factors')\n    plt.grid(True)\n    plt.xticks(range(1, 21))\n    plt.yticks([i/10 for i in range(11)])\n    plt.ylim(0, 1)\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.show()\n\ndef main():\n    N = 1024\n    rounds = 20\n    reduction_factors = [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]  # Reduction factors ranging from 0.5 to 1.0\n    probabilities_dict = {}\n\n    for reduction_factor in reduction_factors:\n        probabilities = calculate_win_probabilities(N, rounds, reduction_factor)\n        probabilities_dict[reduction_factor] = probabilities\n        for i, prob in enumerate(probabilities, 1):\n            print(f\"Reduction Factor {reduction_factor}, Round {i}: Cumulative probability of winning = {prob:.10f}\")\n\n    plot_cumulative_probabilities(probabilities_dict)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\nThe graph is shown below:\n\nThe source code is provided below. Feel free to modify the parameters and explore different scenarios!\n\n[https://www.kaggle.com/code/isakatsuyoshi/theoretical-analysis-of-the-20-questions-game](https://www.kaggle.com/code/isakatsuyoshi/theoretical-analysis-of-the-20-questions-game)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis analysis provides a clear understanding of how the probability of identifying the keyword changes with each round of questions. Notably, the variation in winning probability based on different reduction factors serves as a crucial indicator for building effective questioning strategies.\n\nI hope you find this discussion helpful. Please feel free to share any questions or feedback in the comments!\n\nThis concludes my theoretical analysis of winning probability and strategy in the 20 Questions game. Thank you for reading!\n\n",
