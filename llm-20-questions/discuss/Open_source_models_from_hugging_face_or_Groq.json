            "content": "The evaluation environment does not access the internet. Model weights must be loaded into submission. Therefore, an API call that relies on an internet connection would not work. Models on HF can be used, but you need to either download the snapshot and upload or use the save pretrained function within the transformers library. Since groq would rely on an internet connection, it would not work. \n\n",
