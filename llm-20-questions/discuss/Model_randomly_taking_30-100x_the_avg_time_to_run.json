            "content": "not sure how relevant our experiences are, but we found a couple cases that can lead into this issue\n\n- huggingface model offloading some weights to the CPU instead of putting them all on GPU,there's a flag to disable this behaviour\n\n- model not reaching its stop token:\nthe model is a base model rather than a chat or an instruct model, these model just go on forever\nthe model is used behind some library with its internal retry mechanism (looking at you dspy), these libraries tend to prompt the model over and over until it got the right structure from the model, and this leads to some cryptic time variances\n\nlooking at your times there's a massive jump, which might hint you're making some conditional switching? like switching between hard-coded questions to an actual llm? If that's the case it's probably where to check first\n\n",
