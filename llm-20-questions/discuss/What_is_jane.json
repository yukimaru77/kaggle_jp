        "content": "As a non-native language speaker, Jane has always been just a name of a person. Checked out in GPT, and it also thinks \"Jane\" is just a name.\n\nUnderstanding that as of now, in the set of secret keywords being used in episodes there are 500 location (from keywords.py), 500 things (from keywords.py), and 1000 new things (the hidden set), I have a real problem to understand where the keyword \"Jane\" came from. \n\nCan someone help?\n\nBTW. My bot trained for persons also was magically able to guess this name ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥\n\n",
