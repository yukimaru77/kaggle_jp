Use a Different Device or Browser: Try using a different device (if available) or a different web browser to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n3. Contact Support: Reach out to the platform's support team or customer service for assistance. They may have additional steps or solutions specific to their verification process.\n\n4. Wait and Retry Later: If technical issues persist, consider waiting and attempting verification at a later time when the system might be more responsive.\n\n[@ppujari](https://www.kaggle.com/ppujari) \n\n",
