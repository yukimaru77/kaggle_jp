        "content": "Currently, old agents do not play much. In these settings, old agents with high scores have the chance to remain the leaders, and old ones with low scores have almost no chance to grow in skill. Therefore, I have questions regarding the evaluation on the hidden test set.\n\nWill all agents play at the same frequency on the new vocabulary of keywords?\n\nWill the skill rating be reset to 600 for all agents before the rerun?\n\n[@Host](https://www.kaggle.com/Host) #Kaggle\n\n",

The standard deviation decreases after each match, reflecting more certainty around that agent’s score. I believe in similar Kaggle environment competitions, the host reset each agent’s standard deviation but not the mean.\n\n",
