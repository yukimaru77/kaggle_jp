In the spirit of Chris Deotte releasing his code, I am sharing a notebook that incorporates some alternative strategies and a different model. It also includes an evaluation session and debugger that can be used to improve your model in real-time in the notebook. 

Notebook is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/matthewsfarmer/llm-20q-starter-notebook-2-0)

I am excited to see some of the different strategies other competitors have used for this competition as it comes to a close.

Happy coding! Cheers.
