        "content": "Title. Since after the final submission deadline, keywords get swapped. I imagine people who are relying hard memorized keywords would perform a lot worse. Would the current leaderboard have an effect, if at all, on the final prize contending evaluation? If not then what's the point of the ranking and scoring system?\n\nBut if the current leaderboard and scoring does affect final prize contending then I would argue this isn't entirely fair?\n\nAs stated in another post, the current system can be EASILY gamed by making the LLM hard memoize which keywords to use and what questions to ask (you may even use a non-LLM and achieve better results since it's just a rule based filtering problem). All they have to do is change the submission every once awhile when the keywords list change. And before the final submission deadline, use a different more generalized submission\n\n",
