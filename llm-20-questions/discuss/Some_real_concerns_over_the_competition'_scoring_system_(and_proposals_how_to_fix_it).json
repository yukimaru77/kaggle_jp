        "content": "Hi Kaggle Team,\n\nI am truly interested in competing in this competition, but the concerns raised below also truly made me lose most interest in it. I hope you can review and make comments or adjustment to the game design, to attract more people into the contest.\n\n1. There are no true competitiveness in the match-up\n\nUnlike all of the previous Kaggle simulation competitions (Halite, Rock/Paper/Scissors, Snake, ….) where there are real \"versus\" match, this \"20 Questions Game\" actually does NOT have any aspects for the \"versus\" at all. In specific, how a team (composed of a questioner and an answerer) performs in a match does NOT have any impact to the opponent's team. As a result, pairing to form a match-up makes no sense. Indeed, just forming 1 team for a single \"testing\" and count the number of questions needed to guess the correct keyword should be a much better metric on the LB.\n\n2. Tied games (games resulting a draw) are so populous, devastating to the higher ranked bots, and inexplicably rewarding to the lower ranked bots\n\nSince the match-up is not truly competitive at all (explain in point 1), it is converged to the notion that each bot just needs to care for its own sake, not caring anything else, not even the opponent's team. However, this is still so far to guess the correct keyword. The perfect questioner still depends heavily on the answerer to be able to correctly guess the keyword.\n\nIn short, to actually \"WIN\" a game is so difficult. It needs to have 3 following aspects to form a win: a) The questioner must be very good in playing \"20 questions\". b) The answerer must be at least a valid (and good) LLM. and c) No error formed by any of the 4 bots\n\nI saw one of my bots amazingly guessed out the keyword in 4 steps, got 45 points on the LB, jumped to 1st place. Then, in 3 next consecutive games it acts as the answerer and at least draws all games, but still got heavily deducted until it cancels out that amazing win.\n\nThe ratio between a good win and the tied games is extremely low. Hence, the mechanism of point deduction in tied games for higher ranked bots (and also increasing points for lower bots) need to be rectified, otherwise good bots can never surface on the top of the LB.\n\nHowever, making rectifying on the scoring like that still poses some other weaknesses that we still can't foresee. I still prefer changing the match-up format to the \"testing\" metric, that is: single question-answerer pairing only with no matchup, and LB is based on the average metric such as:\n\n0.8* (average number of questions needed to guess correctly as the questioner) + 0.2 * (average number of questions needed to guess correctly as the answerer)\n\nPlease have a look and my points.\n\n[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) [@addisonhoward](https://www.kaggle.com/addisonhoward) [@mylesoneill](https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill) \n\n",

It can't be 0 otherwise you'll have many local minima on the LB, all will come to luck when a new bot is submitted: who will it be paird to.\n\n",

A Draw should give zero (or -1) points to everyone independent of the level/skill.\n\n",
