        "content": "Given the nature of this competition, does it even make sense to enter late, say in a month or two?\n\nBecause more battles means potentially more points. \"Older\" bots are also way more likely to win, given that they've been fine-tuned and adjusted more. \n\nI've read in the overview that newer bots will be paired \"more often than older bots\", but does this negate the lost time?\n\nJoining any competition late has it's up- and downsides of course, but this one feels way more downsided. Anyone has some experience with this?\n\n",

EVEN in LIFE. Except those on prize/money zone matters.\n\nTherefore, leave your mark. I've already left my shitful stuff.\n\nBesides, you have quality knowledge to deliver. Bring it on! Users can learn with your worthy job. \n\nMake up your mind, in a month or two it'll still matter .\n\n",
