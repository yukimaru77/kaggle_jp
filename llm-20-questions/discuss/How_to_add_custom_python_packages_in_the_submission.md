# How to add custom python packages in the submission?

**sakura** *Tue Jun 04 2024 21:04:34 GMT+0900 (æ—¥æœ¬æ¨™æº–æ™‚)* (2 votes)

Hi, all. I'm a new hand to Kaggle. I want to know how can I know what packages are in the online evaluation, and whether I can add new packages (for example, from pip install). It seems that this can be done through submitting a notebook. I'm wondering if I can add custom packages through submitting the tar file? (Such as adding an requirements.txt?). Thanks for any help and response!
