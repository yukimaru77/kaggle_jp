# Keywords list is not fully correct and could use improvement

I have seen discussions of errors in keyword list and have seen instances of this in replays myself. I (along with many other people) believe that the keywords should be fixed and updated. Currently, I believe the most important and frustrating thing in the keywords is when a keyword does not have enough alternatives. Just now I had a game (with myself as it was validation) where the keyword was guessed 3 times in one game but failed as it was slightly different.

[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) can we get any comment on this? Will this be resolved in the private LB?
