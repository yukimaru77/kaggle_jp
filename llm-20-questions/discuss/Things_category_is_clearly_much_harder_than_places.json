For example a \"dog\"; however, in this competition instead of \"dog\" the keyword would probably be \"mainly white but slightly brown-spotted furry large and happy jumping chihuahua\" ðŸ˜‚ \n\n[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) are the adjectives before the objects added on purpose or is this one an accident? Also, will the private LB keywords be like this?\n\nEDIT: I can't take it anymore\n\n",
