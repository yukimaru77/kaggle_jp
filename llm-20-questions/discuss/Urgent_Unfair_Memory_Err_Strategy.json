        "content": "I found that if someone's agent gets an Err, all the other 3 Agents will get a + Point.\n\nThis can be misused by questioner prompting as much words as possible (lengthy prompts), so that if the answerer's agent has less available memory, it will result in an Err and all points will be given to the other 3 agents, while the Err agent get a - point.\n\nEven if they all didn't guess the correct keyword.\n\nThis strategy is vulnerable to those who don't have a condition to give a backup answer when there is no output from the agent, especially for those who are using big size LLMs and lengthy answerer prompt too.\n\nShould be fixed by not giving + points to the other 3 if an agent gets an Err. (Only - point to the Err agent.)\n\n",
