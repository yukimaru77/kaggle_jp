        "content": "I just entered this competition and noticed a huge number of agents with around 600 points that were only made for testing purposes (answering only yes for example), which could be hindering new players from climbing the leaderboard. I've read about the 10% chance to play with higher-rated players, but it seems to take a lot of time to take effect. It would be interesting to see how long a copy of the top 1 on LB beginning with 600 points would take to return to have a high score again. Maybe two alternative possibilities to try to solve this problem:\n\n1 - When entering a new agent, if you win the test episode against yourself, your agent begins with something like 650 or 700 points instead of 600.\n\n2 - Remove agents without a single win in the last 100 games and less than 650 points.\n\nWhat do you think about it?\n\n",

In a different thread, [@lowmaa](https://www.kaggle.com/lowmaa) called this \"escaping the pit of dumbness.\"\n\nIn my experience, when I submit a good agent, it plays around 10 matches on the first day, which usually allows it to get one win and rise to the 700 range. Unfortunately, it then only plays one or two matches each day, so further progress is slow.\n\n",
