So our final solution should not use the keywords.py file.\n\nAlso the current public LB list will change very soon, explained [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/509035)\n\n",

According to my understanding, the categories will be stable, but the keywords will change across the whole competition, and a private word set will be used in the final period. Is that correct?\n\n",
