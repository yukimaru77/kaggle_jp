# Submit selection

In this competition, I cannot select a submission on the submissions page.

The last three submissions will be evaluated.

Does this mean that I have to manage and fill up the last three submissions myself with the ones I want to be evaluated?

And do I have to keep the last three submissions that I want to submit as the final submission at the time of the competition closing?
