# Example of successful round

I am new to the challenge and just skimmed through the submissions and some episodes. I am yet to find a successful episode, i.e. an episode in which an agent correctly guessed the keyword. It would be even more interesting to see an episode that also contains some questions vaguely narrowing down on the keyword.

Do such episodes exist (yet)? In this case, it'd be very helpful if someone could point me to such an episode.
