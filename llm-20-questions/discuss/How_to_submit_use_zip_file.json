        "content": "Hi, all. I want to submit my agent through a zip file. Here is my file structure:\n\n```\n├── lib\n├── main.py\n├── models\n\n```\n\nI uploaded through kaggle competitions submit -c llm-20-questions -f submission.zip -m \"debug-file-upload\". But the agent check failed and the log from agent-1 and 2 are both empty, and there is no replay. It seems that I somehow put the main.py in the wrong place?\n\nI'm wondering how will this zip file be processed after uploading. Where will it be put and how will it be decompressed? Should I include a submission/ subdir for the zip file?\n\n",

Add the following code to the beginning of your main.py:\n\n```\nKAGGLE_AGENT_PATH = \"/kaggle_simulations/agent/\"\nif os.path.exists(KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH):\n    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH, 'lib'))\nelse:\n    sys.path.insert(0, \"/kaggle/working/submission/lib\")\n\n```\n\n",

Moreover, I can submit successfully with the Starter Notebook after I copy all of my main.py, paste it to the corresponding position in the Starter Notebook, and submit the notebook. But somehow when I'm uploading the zip file it doesn't work (and without error message).\n\n",

If you download logs, you will see the specific error message.\n\nAlso you can use print statements inside your main.py file and print debugging info. These print statements will show up in your logs.\n\n",
