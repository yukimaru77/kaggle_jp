The contents of the keywords.py file available in the Data tab of this competition differ from the updated keywords.py file available on Kaggle's GitHub([https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/keywords.py)](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments/blob/master/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/keywords.py)).\n\nWhen I print(kaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.keywords.KEYWORDS_JSON) in my notebook, it matches the file in the Data tab.\n\nSo, where is the update to the keywords.py file that you mentioned being applied?\n\n",

            "content": "It seems the updated set of keywords is way more difficult than the previous one. We're going to see even lower success rate. I recently updated my agents, 44 games in total and not a single guess on any side. I don't mean to complain or suggest any changes, just a few remarks:\n\nContrary to some earlier hints, there are abstract/conceptual terms -- \"analogy\", \"interstate\", \"hearing aid\", \"vegetation\". These are not specific objects and I think more difficult to find out.\n\nThere are keywords which have many synonyms, but alts are not provided, so even if an agent comes close to the concept of \"ointment\", it could still need many turns to find the right word among words that are difficult to tell apart: lotion, cream, balsam, balm, gel, oil.\n\nThere are keywords that are so specific/rare that I don't think we could expect them to be ever solved if they were not listed, e.g. \"pot holder\", \"sippy cup\", \"elliptical trainers\", \"graphic novel\". Some of them a normal person would have never used or heard of. Can small LLMs handle them? I bet not in 20 questions, but who knows..\n\nSo the challenge is serious. Perhaps some players would like to make a real effort, however it's a little bit discouraging to hear that the rules and/or types of keywords could change again, possibly rendering the effort a waste of time.\n\n",

I think the Kaggle team need to manually look into the keywords and exclude those strange 2-word words. “Bike path” is a composition word and can’t be predicted by an LLM in 20 questions. Even human, how can a human expect to predict the word “elliptical trainers’?\n\n",

Can we do some calculations to find optimal question in runtime relying on the keywords.py file? Or will the final dictionary be complitely unavailable in runtime during the final evaluation?\n\nSorry, if you already answered it, but I found the different opinions in the discussion thread\n\n",
