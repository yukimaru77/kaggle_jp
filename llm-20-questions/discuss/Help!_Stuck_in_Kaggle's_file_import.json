        "content": "Following the tutorial, I have a notebook and the following file structure (see Image).  This graphical interface is a bit misleading, main.py is inside of submission folder, not inside the lib folder.\n\nSo I run the game from my Kaggle notebook with game_output = env.run(agents=[simple_agent, simple_agent, simple_agent , \"/kaggle/working/submission/main.py\"]) and everything works until now.\n\nHowever now \"main.py\" needs some methods of the \"gemma\" module. I tried importing them with sys.path.insert(0, \"/kaggle/working/submission/lib\")\n    sys.path.insert(0, \"./lib\") and from gemma.config import * but I always get: \"No module named 'gemma.config'\".\n\nI confirmed that gemma has an \"init.py\" file and I can't figure out how to import its methods into my main. Any tips appreciated!!\n\n[Captura de pantalla 2024-06-07 a las 11.34.58.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/2859842/20789/Captura de pantalla 2024-06-07 a las 11.34.58.png)",
