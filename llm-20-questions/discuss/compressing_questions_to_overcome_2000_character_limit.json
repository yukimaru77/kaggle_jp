I could be misunderstanding the problem but shouldn't it be possible to compress information for example the first thing that comes to mind is using something like camel case to get rid of spaces in questions to make the 2000 characters go further. It seems like a good approach would be to not confine the bots to play like a humans would. I could be totally wrong though would love to hear what everyone thinks.\n\n",

However the format of the competition is two Kaggle teams versus two Kaggle teams and this limits us.\n\nEach team has a \"questioner\" and \"answerer\". If we invent a new language where the words are 50% shorter, then we can increase the information per question by 2x. However the \"answerer\" will not understand our new language. Therefore the format of the competition prevents \"questioners\" from doing anything too untypical.\n\n",
