If the episode fails, the submission is marked as error and you can download the agent logs to help figure out why. Otherwise, we initialize the submission with μ0=600 and it joins the pool of for ongoing evaluation.\n\nI have noticed that a true win or loss changes score more than a tie (i.e. no team gets a correct answer).\n\n",
