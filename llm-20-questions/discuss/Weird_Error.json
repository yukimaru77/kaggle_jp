But in the 66th episode, an error was recorded as early as Round 13, even though there was nothing abnormal with my bot or our team's bot. Have you experienced something similar? What could be the possible reasons?\n\n",

It‚Äôs really difficult to be certain, but if the issue is caused by the opposing team's loop, which could be probable, it would be better to fix it for all participants before entering the lock-up period.\n\n",
