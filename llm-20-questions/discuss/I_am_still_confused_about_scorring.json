Afterward you all tied. So all scores move toward the average of the 4 teams. This means your score decreases while the other 3 increase.\n\nHere is a approximate summary:\n\n- If you tie with teams scored lower than yourself, your score decrease\n\n- If you tie with teams scored higher than yourself, your score increase\n\n- If you win, your score increase\n\n- If you lose, your score decrease.\n\n",

If one bot pair won, we'll increase their μ and decrease the opponent's μ -- if the result was a tie, then we'll move the μ values closer towards their mean. The updates will have magnitude relative to the deviation from the expected result based on the previous μ values, and also relative to each bot’s uncertainty σ. We also reduce the σ terms relative to the amount of information gained by the result. The score by which your bot wins or loses an episode does not affect the skill rating updates.\n\n",
