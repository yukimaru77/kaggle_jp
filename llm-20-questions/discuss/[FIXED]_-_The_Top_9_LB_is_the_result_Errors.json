        "title": "[FIXED] - The Top 9 LB is the result Errors",
        "content": "On May 29 at 14:00 UTC, I noticed the top 9 agents on the LB were all the result of gaining points from their teammate throwing an error. (The top 9 teams at 14:00 UTC were: Dapeng, Agney, Neel, Mitul, Neige, Agney, Gol-eel, tr, Mesmerized).\n\nFor each of the top 9 agents on LB, I reviewed their most recent game where they achieved positive points. I display these below. In each case, they received points because their teammate errored.\n\nIs this the intended scoring mechanism? [@develra](https://www.kaggle.com/develra) [@addisonhoward](https://www.kaggle.com/addisonhoward) Should luck be the reason teams climb the LB?\n\nIMO, when an agent throws an error, I suggest that the defective bot loses points and all 3 other bots ignore the game. (i.e. the other 3 bots get zero points and they immediately get a new game to replace the erroneous game). \n\nGuessing the keyword is difficult and there shouldn't be an easy way to gain lots of free points. (And on private LB, guessing will be even more difficult without a list of keywords).\n\n## 1st Place\n\n## 2nd Place\n\n## 3rd Place\n\n## 4th Place\n\n## 5th Place\n\n## 6th Place\n\n## 7th Place\n\n## 8th Place\n\n## 9th Place\n\n",

This destabilizes the leaderboard because now the original top LB bots will play with and against these bots whose true score is under 600. \n\n## New 1st Place\n\n## New 5th Place\n\nand the new 5th jumped there because their teammate had an error:\n\n",

Earlier versions of my bots had errors and each day I remove errors and improve my bots. So don't worry about submitting bots with errors. Continue to try new things and submit whatever you want.\n\nI think the competition metric should be updated so that bot errors do not help other bots.\n\n",

For example the failing agent might get -21 and the other three get an average of +7 each.\n\nPenalizing the failing agent is important to keep the leaderboards clear and not allow a \"error on purpose\" strategy to exist. (eg if an agent hasn't guessed after X rounds and knows the average game at their level is X + 1, they could error on purpose if there was no penalty for doing so). \n\n",
