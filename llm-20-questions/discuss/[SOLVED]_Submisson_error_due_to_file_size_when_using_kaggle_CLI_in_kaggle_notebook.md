# [SOLVED] Submisson error due to file size when using kaggle CLI in kaggle notebook

Hello,

I am working on the competition based on this [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/robikscube/intro-to-rigging-for-llm-20-questions-llama3), but I get the following error when trying to submit from the notebook.

400 - Bad Request - Submission not allowed:  Your file exceeds the maximum size of 20 GB.

Does anyone know how to submit files larger than 20GB? or is the submission file limited to that size for this competition? (I couldn' t find such a statement though.)

Thank you in advance.
