Servers are now back online, but we have about 2k matches to play through. I estimate this will take 12-18 hours to complete (I'll post once that happens). \n\nUntil we are caught back up:\n\nsubmissions will take a long while to process\nyou'll see matches queue for a long time\nnew submissions will have very few matches\n\nI'll update here once we have caught up!\n\nEDIT: This has been resolved and submissions and matches should be processing as normal now. Thanks!\n\n",
