        "content": "Hey all,\n\nHere is an update on what to expect from the final weeks of the competition.\n\n- Active agents reduced from 3 to 2 (starting this week, which will increase the game rate)\n\n- Question character length limit reduced from 2000 to 750 (the extra character limit was unused other than for “binary search” type questions)\n\n- Remove “Locations” from the keyword set. (starting this week, the “locations” problem space it too small)\n\nWhen the competition closes:\n\n- The unseen secret “things” keyword list will be swapped in\n\n- The leaderboard will be reset\n\n- The post-evaluation period will start at 2 weeks, but will likely be extended.\n\nThank you all for participating! This competition is the first of its kind and we appreciate your patience while we learned along the way. We’ll take what we learned in this competition to make future competitions even better!\n\nHappy Kaggling!\n\nBovard\n\nEDIT: \n\nOn the secret \"things\" keyword list\n\n- it is taken from roughly same keyword list as the current list. \n\n- it will not re-use any of the current words in the keyword list\n\n- it will not be accessible in keywords.py\n\n",

We will ensure that agents receive enough games for the leaderboard to stabilize under the new set of words, so even if your agent is severly under ranked it should not be an issue.\n\n",

This way, there's no need to inactivate high-scoring bots in order to continue experimenting, and if they are permanently disabled then there's no risk of anyone sandbagging by temporarily disabling and later re-enabling a strong bot. I think this would create a more robust competition with few downsides.\n\n",
