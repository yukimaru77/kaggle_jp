So when working with Notebooks, it takes a VM reset to test the notebook with a new keyword, or perhaps I missed the way to re-draw the keyword? A way to control the sampling of keywords for testing would be helpful.\n\nI tried\n\n```\nimport importlib\nimportlib.reload(kaggle_environments)\n\n```\n\nbut it doesn't work.\n\n",

You'll also want to change the alts and category variables. \n\nI put an example in my public notebook ([https://www.kaggle.com/code/rturley/run-debug-llm-20-questions-in-a-notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rturley/run-debug-llm-20-questions-in-a-notebook)), and the relevant code would be:\n\n```\nimport kaggle_environments\nenv = kaggle_environments.make(environment=\"llm_20_questions\")\n\n# Set the new keyword to \"Duck\"\nkeyword = \"Duck\"\nalts = [\"The Duck\",\"A Duck\"]\nkaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.category = \"Example\"\nkaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.keyword_obj = {'keyword':keyword,'alts':alts}\nkaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.keyword = keyword\nkaggle_environments.envs.llm_20_questions.llm_20_questions.alts = alts\n\n```\n\n",
