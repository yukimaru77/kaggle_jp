        "content": "If anyone is interested, I think the LB got moving from all 600.0 because of this lucky game where the keyword was \"france\". ðŸ˜€ It is the only non-tied game I have seen this far.\n\n[https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-episode-54792273](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/leaderboard?dialog=episodes-episode-54792273)\n\nLucky, because the example notebook uses \"france\" in its few_shot_examples, which I guess primed the bot.\n\n",

All of those internal \"moves\" would still be hidden.\n\n",
