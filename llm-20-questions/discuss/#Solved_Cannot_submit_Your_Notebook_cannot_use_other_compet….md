# #Solved: Cannot submit: Your Notebook cannot use other competitions as a data source in this competition.

I cannot submit, even though I don't use other competition's data. 

Have to use this llama [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/junglebeastds/llama3instruct](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/junglebeastds/llama3instruct) because I cannot get access to the official LLAMA3 on Kaggle.
