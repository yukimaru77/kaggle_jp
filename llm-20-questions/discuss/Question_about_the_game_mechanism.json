        "content": "Hi, I am wondering about the basic 2v2 mechanism of the game. **Are we required to submit 4 agents that have 2 pairs of questioner and answerer agents in total? **\n\nBy the way, what form of the file do we need to submit? Is it the format like what we see in the LLM_20_questions starter notebook? \n\nThe next problem is that we are unclear about how our file will work in the Kaggle environments. It means that after we submit our agents, how can the environment organize and use our codes to play the game? Hope I can get the explanation asap. \n\n",

            "content": "You just need to submit one agent that knows how to handle 3 different roles: \"ask\", \"answer\" and \"guess.\" For example, in the [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rturley/run-debug-llm-20-questions-in-a-notebook) that I posted to show how to run the environment locally, I made a simplistic agent like below:\n\n```\ndef simple_agent1(obs, cfg):\n    if obs.turnType == \"ask\": response = \"Is it a duck?\"\n    elif obs.turnType == \"guess\": response = \"duck\"\n    elif obs.turnType == \"answer\": response = \"no\"\n    return response\n\n```\n\nWhen you submit to the competition, you'll want your agent function to be in a python file like the \"submission/main.py\" example in the starter notebook, and the notebook shows you can add supporting files and zip them in one \"submission.tar.gz\" file.\n\nDuring the competition, you're agent will be one of four different players in a 2v2 environment. Your agent will either be assigned to do all the \"ask\" and \"guess\" turns as it tries to guess the keyword for its team, or your agent will know the keyword and do all the \"answer\" turns as it teammate asks questions.\n\nIf you watch a replay or two from the top teams, it should make sense.\n\nGood luck!\n\n",
