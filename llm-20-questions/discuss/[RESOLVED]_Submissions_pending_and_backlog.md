# [RESOLVED] Submissions pending and backlog

Our servers went down for a few hours, during which we continued to schedule matches (which were subsequently queued). Servers are now back online, but we have about 2k matches to play through. I estimate this will take 12-18 hours to complete (I'll post once that happens). 

Until we are caught back up:

submissions will take a long while to process
you'll see matches queue for a long time
new submissions will have very few matches

I'll update here once we have caught up!

EDIT: This has been resolved and submissions and matches should be processing as normal now. Thanks!
