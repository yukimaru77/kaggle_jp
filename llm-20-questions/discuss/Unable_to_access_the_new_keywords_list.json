Note that there are also hidden words on the public LB that are not shown any where. To view these hidden words, we need to download all the games played on the public LB and extract the keywords. This was done in public notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/waechter/llm-20-questions-games-dataset/notebook) and saved to a CSV file [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/waechter/llm-20-questions-games-dataset/output?select=keywords.csv)\n\n",
