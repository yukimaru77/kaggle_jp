            "content": "I also believe that most lower-level players in this competition should do something like this. However, in my testing, this does not help much because most bots will answer the same thing and it is unlikely to help much. More important is to use a good answerer bot and of the top model choices I believe that Llama 3 is the best answerer all around. So please if you are not consistently in the top ~100 (or even if you are) use Llama 3. It is by far the easiest to work with as it has the highest IF-Eval score.\n\n*IF-Eval score is how well the model is at following instructions and it makes it so that your agent can have very rigorous prompt engineering.\n\n** [LLM Leaderboard use IF-Eval score](https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard)\n\nP.S.: I am seriously considering releasing my code because the dumb bots (no offense to you guys) are making me lose my mind\n\n",
