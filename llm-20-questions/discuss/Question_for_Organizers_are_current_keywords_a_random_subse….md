# Question for Organizers: are current keywords a random subset of the future keyword set

You mentioned that the keywords have already been updated, and that the new keywords would be representative of the future final keyword list. 

Is it safe to assume that the current keywords were selected as a random subset of the final keyword list? Or will the current keywords be extended in a different way?
