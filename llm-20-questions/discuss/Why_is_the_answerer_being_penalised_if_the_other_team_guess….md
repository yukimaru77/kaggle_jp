# Why is the answerer being penalised if the other team guesses the right word?

The scoring system is extremely flawed in the sense that if the answerer is decent and is guiding the other team's questioner to the correct word, in the end it the 'correct' answerer who is getting penalised. 

Because of this behaviour, teams are not being incentivized to come up with a decent answerer. Only if there is a minimal change in the scoring strategy, this would have been much better.
