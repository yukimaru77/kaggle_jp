# Could the final list of keywords be established in a transparent way?

There's plenty of speculation and uncertainty regarding the keywords, in particular the final list of keywords. We know from announcements, that hosts will be watching the situation and reacting appropriately to ensure fair competition. I don't know if the list of keywords is a subject for such appropriate adjustments, but it seems likely. In my humble opinion, reacting to the situation on the LB in the upcoming phase of the competition specifically by adjusting the final list of keywords would be rather unfair. Potentially even very unfair. It would be like moving a goalpost, and intentionally or unintentionally, favoring some solutions at the expense of others.

Of course there's no ground to believe our hosts are not impartial, although sometimes even impartial intent can have a partial effect. Fortunately there's a simple way to handle this without leaving any trace of doubt and cut short any later speculation about the conduct and the final set -- that is preparing the final list of keywords well before the deadline and celebrate the occasion by announcing the hash key of the final list (e.g. SHA256 or any other.) This way everybody could rest assured that the final list was not influenced by any hot situation on the LB shortly before the deadline or any particular final solutions submitted. It would also reassure everybody beforehand that the list is ready and final, and so they don't need to worry about any last minute changes. Also giving an opportunity to describe the final list in a manner fair to everyone.

Certainly I don't want to be alone in this call, so please give it a reaction if you agree, I'm sure our hosts would consider it more seriously then.. ,)

Especially when used creatively and mixed with other approaches. Just point yourself in the direction of your dreams.

I think the situation may get hot shortly before the deadline and if the list of keywords is still an open matter then it may get unpleasantly messy.
