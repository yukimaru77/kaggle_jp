I'd guess: \n\n- we will see a lot more convergence as agents with more skill start to consistently win matches\n\n- part of the convergence will be fake as some agents are optimized on the public keywords\n\n- after August 13th, the agents at top of the leaderboard that are optimized on the public keywords will drop off and a new set of agents will converge to the top of the leaderboard\n\n",
