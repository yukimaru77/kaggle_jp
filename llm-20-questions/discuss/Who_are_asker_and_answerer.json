The answerer only responds yes or no. Below is an example:\n\n```\nRound 1\nQuestioner: Is it a country?\nAnswerer: yes\nQuestioner: France?\n\nRound 2\nQuestioner: Is the country in Europe?\nAnswerer: no\nQuestioner: China?\n\n```\n\nNotice how the questioner says two things each round and the answerer says one thing each round.\n\n",
