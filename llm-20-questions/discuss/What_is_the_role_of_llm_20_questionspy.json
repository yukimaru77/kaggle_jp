            "content": "You don't need to worry about llm_20_questions.py, it's part of the environment to run the game. You need to implement agent_fn function, e.g.:\n\n```\ndef agent_fn(obs, cfg):\n    if obs.turnType == \"ask\":\n        response = \"Is it a duck?\"\n    elif obs.turnType == \"answer\":\n        response = \"no\"\n    elif obs.turnType == \"guess\":\n        response = \"two ducks\"\n    return response\n\n```\n\n[This notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rturley/run-debug-llm-20-questions-in-a-notebook) should help you understand.\n\n",
