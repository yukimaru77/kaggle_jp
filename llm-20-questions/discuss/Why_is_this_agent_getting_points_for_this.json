When they win they compare their collective rating vs mhericks rating which should give them an expected probability of winning. In this case all of the agents are relatively the same rated.\n\nHowever this is also a second component of our scoring system, an uncertainty term that decays as agents play more game. In this case both Toon and hsling have a larger uncertainty term (so they get more rating from the game) than Pham team (who receives less rating)\n\nSecond game:\n\n[1st] hsling 599 (-0)\n\n[1st] ITASps 599 (-0)\n\n[1st] Gauranshu Rathee 596 (+1)\n\n[1st] Guan 600 (-0)\n\nThe game result here was a tie (everyone on 1st place) and everyone is similarly rated so the expected change in rating should be quite small. Besides the -0 here, this looks expected.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!\n\n",
