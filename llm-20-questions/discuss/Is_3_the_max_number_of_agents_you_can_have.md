# Is 3 the max number of agents you can have?

I was wondering why the highest number of agents on the leaderboard I saw was only 3. What happens if I submit 4 models? Do I have to choose 3 of them to compete? Thanks in advance!

> It looks like only your most recent 3 submissions contribute to your LB score. So if you have 3 and submit 1 more. Then your first (out of the original 3) stops counting toward your LB score (and instead your newest i.e. 4th sub begins counting).
