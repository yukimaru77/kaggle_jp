# Can models be too smart?

I was looking through my model logs of a new agent that I added all my changes to and I was extremely impressed later I thought that my model might be too complicated and too "smart" for other agents for example when my model is the questioner lower/"dumber" answerers might not be able to even answer correctly. I am not fully sure if this is a problem so I wanted to know what the wider community felt because I am sure that everyone who is regularly at the top has at least once considered this. Here are some images of my model's logs not sure if I just made a good/best agent or if other people already have similar results.

P.S. I am not trying to be narcissistic but I just had this question after what in my mind was a "godly" model. I also have many more "smart" question images from my model but can't post them here if you want a link with a file of my agent logs I can create a google drive or something (just ask)

P.P.S. Also not sure if anyone else has a model with results like this but this is my first good questioner model previously I had a good answerer that carried my score
