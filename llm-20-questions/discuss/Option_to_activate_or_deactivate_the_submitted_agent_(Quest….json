My old agent was performing well compared to the new agent but my old agent got paused because of the rule. \n\nSuggestion: Put a limit on the active agents but the activation, deactivation control should be given to the participants.\n\ncc\n\n[@ryanholbrook](https://www.kaggle.com/ryanholbrook) \n\n[@addisonhoward](https://www.kaggle.com/addisonhoward) \n\n",

On the leaderboard, only your best scoring bot will be shown, but you can track the progress of all of your submissions on your Submissions page.\n\nThis is from the overview page. I'm not sure how it is actually working on the LB tho. \n\n",
