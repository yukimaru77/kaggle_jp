It seems that this can be done through submitting a notebook. I'm wondering if I can add custom packages through submitting the tar file? (Such as adding an requirements.txt?). Thanks for any help and response!\n\n",

Then finally tarball the entire folder /kaggle/working/submission/lib. Afterward submit the tarball to the competition.\n\nAlso note that inside your main.py file you will need to add to system path so that it can find your pip installs:\n\n```\nKAGGLE_AGENT_PATH = \"/kaggle_simulations/agent/\"\nif os.path.exists(KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH):\n    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH, 'lib'))\nelse:\n    sys.path.insert(0, \"/kaggle/working/submission/lib\")\n\n```\n\nTo see an example of tarballing, see code cell #3 and #4 in starter notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/llm-20-questions-starter-notebook). Afterward we submit submission.tar.gz to the competition.\n\n",
