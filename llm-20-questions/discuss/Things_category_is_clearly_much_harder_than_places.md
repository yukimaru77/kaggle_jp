# Things category is clearly much harder than places

Given that these keywords are equally split. You'd be much better off focusing on building a bot that just get's every country or city right.

How is an LLM going to guess any of these??

iv, fire escape ladder, guard tower, kale smoothie, stained glass window (why does it have to be stained??), turn signal (an unbelievably specific component of a car), soap suds (what are these??), finger food, cooling tower, coffee makers (??), stair stepper
