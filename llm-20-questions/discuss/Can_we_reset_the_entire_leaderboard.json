        "content": "Currently, the leaderboard is clogged up by old (and great) location-only models that will slowly move down. However, this will also affect other models that have adjusted to the changes. As of right now, it is much harder to compare scores because of all of the half-keyword models. Is it possible to return scores to 600 or is this not possible to achieve for the competition hosts? [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) \n\n",

            "content": "The current LB is not very meaningful, but in my opinion resetting would not make it better, or fix anything.\n\nI believe our hosts are watching closely and will adjust the ranking algorithm to ensure convergence in the final stage, which doesn't seem to be very robust at the moment. One particular issue appears to be a \"pit of dumbness\" down there around 600 and below (no offense to any cute agents always saying \"yes\"), and it's difficult to get out of there even if your agent is relatively smart (e.g. it can play reasonably against itself.)\n\nLet's understand the reluctance of the hosts to react, regarding any issue. Any intervention or unexpected change works against reliability and trust, and is potentially disrespectful to someone's effort already made, so the justification must be rock solid.\n\n",

The solution to that may fall on us, as a community of competitors, to get more intelligent bots in the competition!\n\nThat said, I really appreciate that a new submission gets a dozen or more matches during their first day, so there is a reasonable chance to escape that pit of dumbness with just one win.\n\n",

Initially this should be about 10% of the total games, and we will adjust as needed. This should allow agents an opportunity to play with higher rated opponents enough to break the deadlock.\n\nEDIT: looks like there is a bug with this functionality. It is currently disabled until we can get that fixed.\n\n",
