Since the answerer can answer in any case without it being penalized, there is an opportunity to \"cheat\" by sending up to 3-bits of information in addition to the yes/no information by the answerer.\n\nMaybe someone could find a scheme to exploit this.\n\n",

This allows us to encode and pass 2 bits of information to the guesser.\n\nFor example, if the word's first letter is between A-F we respond at time=10, if first letter is between G-L we respond at time=20, if first letter is between M-R we respond at time=30, if first letter is between S-Z we respond at time=40. (And of course our response is \"yes\" or \"no\" to the question asked).\n\nThe problem with this approach is that both the questioner and answerer would need to follow this system. Perhaps this is why Kaggle chose to use teams of two instead of allowing one Kaggler to be both the questioner and answerer.\n\n",
