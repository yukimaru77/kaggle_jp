        "content": "I was wondering this since most successful methods exclusively use the keyword set and would fail horribly if none of the current keywords were in the final test set - e.g. bots which use lexicographical ordering (does the kw come before 'x' in alphabetical order etc.) rely exclusively on having access to such words beforehand.\n\nI personally think these are far less interesting than using LLMs or other methods - you could simply write a bunch of checks see which type of such pre-built question is being asked and the competition wouldn't require any LLMs to be used…\n\n",

If they release the full set then they will just add those words to their list and yea…no LLM needed.\n\n",
