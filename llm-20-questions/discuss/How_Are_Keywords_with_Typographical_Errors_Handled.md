# How Are Keywords with Typographical Errors Handled?

Hello,

While analyzing the keywords, I found a few words that seem to contain typographical errors. The list of these words is as follows:

isafahan iran â†’ isfahan

nurumberg germany â†’ nuremberg

zincantan mexico â†’ zinacantan

mount saint lias â†’ mount saint elias

On the left are the words from the keywords.py file, and on the right are the actual words. I am curious about the scoring results when an agent encounters these keywords and provides the correct word.

I am concerned that answering "isfahan" for "isafahan" might result in an incorrect response.
