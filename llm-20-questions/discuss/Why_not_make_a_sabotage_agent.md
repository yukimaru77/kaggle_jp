# Why not make a sabotage agent?

In this competition, the pair of Questinior and Answerer get better scores if they collaborate and don't lie. However what if someone made a purposefully deceiving agent for making other agents's scores worse? Is this illegal or am I missing something? Thank you for considering my question!
