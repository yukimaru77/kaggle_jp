Then Kaggle responds with yes or no (and Kaggle will not lie). Then your teammate the answerer guesses a possible word. Then Kaggle responds if your are correct or not (and Kaggle will not lie).\n\nYour team of two bots is competing against another team of two bots to discover the word first.\n\nUPDATE: Read Nicholas' comment below\n\n",
