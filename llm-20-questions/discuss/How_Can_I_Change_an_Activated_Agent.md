# How Can I Change an Activated Agent?

**tiod0611** *Sat Jul 06 2024 23:42:21 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)* (0 votes)

Hello, I submitted an incorrect Agent. Due to a poorly written prompt, this Agent repeatedly causes [Err]. I want to remove this Agent, but I cannot find a button to delete the Agent in the Submission tab. What should I do? Please help.
