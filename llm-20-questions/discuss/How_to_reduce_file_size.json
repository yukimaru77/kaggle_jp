The submission file caps out at 100 Gb's, and most ~8b parameter models take up only around 10-15 Gbs.\n\nThe pigz compression programme is what most people are using for this competition:\n\n```\n!tar --use-compress-program='pigz --fast --recursive | pv' -cf submission.tar.gz -C /kaggle/input/path/to/weights . -C /kaggle/working/submission .\n\n```\n\nYou can also just use the following to clone every file in your submission/ directory, where -9 indicates the maximum level of compression:\n\n```\n!tar -cf - -C submission . | pigz -9 > submission.tar.gz \n\n```\n\n",
