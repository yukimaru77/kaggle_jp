For example, when our bot achieves a high score, we can then disable our bot to prevent the score from decreasing. Then in the last 1 hour of the competition we can enable the bot and get 1st place public LB.\n\nI think our final position in public LB is our seed going into private LB, so maybe what I say above could be an advantage. There are probably other ways to exploit the LB by turning bots on and off whenever we like.\n\n",
