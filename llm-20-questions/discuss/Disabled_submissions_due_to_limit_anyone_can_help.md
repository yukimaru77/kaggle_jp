# Disabled submissions due to limit: anyone can help?

Hi guys,

I have submitted two additional notebooks in our team with [@risanraja32](https://www.kaggle.com/risanraja32) & [@chandreshjsutariya](https://www.kaggle.com/chandreshjsutariya) but the former submissions have become "Disabled due to the competition's active submission limit". I have read again the docs of the competition but I can't find info on this limit.

Can someone explain me how many submissions we can have and how does that work to select the valid ones?

Thanks!

Best,

Octavio
