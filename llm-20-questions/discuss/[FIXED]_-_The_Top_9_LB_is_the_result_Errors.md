# [FIXED] - The Top 9 LB is the result Errors

**Chris Deotte** *Wed May 29 2024 23:00:06 GMT+0900 (æ—¥æœ¬æ¨™æº–æ™‚)* (19 votes)

On May 29 at 14:00 UTC, I noticed the top 9 agents on the LB were all the result of gaining points from their teammate throwing an error. (The top 9 teams at 14:00 UTC were: Dapeng, Agney, Neel, Mitul, Neige, Agney, Gol-eel, tr, Mesmerized).

For each of the top 9 agents on LB, I reviewed their most recent game where they achieved positive points. I display these below. In each case, they received points because their teammate errored.

Is this the intended scoring mechanism? [@develra](https://www.kaggle.com/develra) [@addisonhoward](https://www.kaggle.com/addisonhoward) Should luck be the reason teams climb the LB?

IMO, when an agent throws an error, I suggest that the defective bot loses points and all 3 other bots ignore the game. (i.e. the other 3 bots get zero points and they immediately get a new game to replace the erroneous game). 

Guessing the keyword is difficult and there shouldn't be an easy way to gain lots of free points. (And on private LB, guessing will be even more difficult without a list of keywords).

## 1st Place

## 2nd Place

## 3rd Place

## 4th Place

## 5th Place

## 6th Place

## 7th Place

## 8th Place

## 9th Place

> UPDATE. I notice the same thing happening on May 30th at 14:00 UTC. The new first place jumped up to LB 660 because their teammate had an error. This destabilizes the leaderboard because now the original top LB bots will play with and against these bots whose true score is under 600.

Earlier versions of my bots had errors and each day I remove errors and improve my bots. So don't worry about submitting bots with errors. Continue to try new things and submit whatever you want.

Because it was very weird that my agent improves almost all the time more or less +10 each time it goes up against another bot; however, its score is still always low.

> [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) I noticed that Mohammad just received 130 points (on June 4th) when his teammate (me Chris) errored. Other teams on the LB need to successfully win 5+ games to get 130 points (which requires the difficult accomplishment of guessing 5+ words correctly versus the lucky result of teammate error).
