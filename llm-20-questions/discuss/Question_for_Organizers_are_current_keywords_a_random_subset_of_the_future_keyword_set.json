                    "content": "[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) Thank you! My question slightly different. It was how the current keyword list was obtained from the full future keyword list.\n\nI could imagine at least four possible situations:\n\n1. Situation 1: Random sampling\n\nYou had a full list of keywords for the future final validation you you randlomly sampled 1000 keywords from it to make the currently used list of keywords.\n\nIt means we can assume that ratio of different groups (countries, cities, mountains, rivers, houshold items, etc) in the final keyword list will be the same as in the currently used 1000 keywords.\n\n2. Situation 2: Random sampling from different groups\n\nYou had a full list of keywords for the future final validation as a list of groups (countries, cities, mountains, rivers, houshold items, etc) and you randomly sampled some amoung from each group to get the currently used 1000 keywords.\n\nIt means we can assume that all main groups that will be used in the final keyword list are represented in the current used 1000 keywords but their ratio can be different.\n\n3. Situation 3: Taking some groups\n\nYou had a full list of keywords for the future final validation as a list of groups (countries, cities, mountains, rivers, houshold items, etc) and you took come of those groups to get the currently used 1000 keywords.\n\nIt means that groups used in the current keyword list will be taken as it for the future final keyword list but some new groups can be added.\n\n4. Situation 4: Soemthing else\n\nThank you for answering, this information is indeed critically important to design any reasonable solution.\n\n",
