Is this the same code used on the leaderboard?\n\n[https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments/blob/da684ac3cd41a43c8cf7e103989c98bba8d05a61/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/llm_20_questions.py#L31](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments/blob/da684ac3cd41a43c8cf7e103989c98bba8d05a61/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/llm_20_questions.py#L31)\n\n```\nGUESSER = \"guesser\"\nANSWERER = \"guesser\"\n\n```\n\nYou can see his post here: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/503163#2821043](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/discussion/503163#2821043)\n\nI noticed the same thing in the code but ignored it as further down in the same script those variables are assigned using methods defined above them: \n\n```\nagents = {GUESSER: guesser_agent, ANSWERER: answerer_agent}\n\n```\n\n[https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments/blob/da684ac3cd41a43c8cf7e103989c98bba8d05a61/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/llm_20_questions.py#L87](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments/blob/da684ac3cd41a43c8cf7e103989c98bba8d05a61/kaggle_environments/envs/llm_20_questions/llm_20_questions.py#L87)\n\nAm I missing something? It does look like a bug when they are assigned the same value at the beginning of the code but then further down they appear to be assigned new appropriate values. \n\nHosts could you please confirm this is not causing an issue?\n\n",
