From what I gather reading the competition description and looking at the keywords used in games on the leaderboard:\n\n- Current games look like they only use the subsection of keywords provided in keywords.py\n\n- After the submission deadline there will be a new set of keywords used.\n\nFrom the [evaluation section](www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-20-questions/overview/evaluation): \n\n\"At the submission deadline on August 13, 2024, submissions will be locked. From August 13, 2024 to August 27th, 2024 we will continue to run episodes against a new set of unpublished, secret words. At the conclusion of this period, the leaderboard is final.\"\n\nThis might mean that the \"pre-deadline\" leaderboard is going to be overfit to these words unfortunately.\n\n",
