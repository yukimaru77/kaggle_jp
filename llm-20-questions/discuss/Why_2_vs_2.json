If one Kaggler made both the Questioner and Answerer, then they don't need to use LLM but could rather ask specific questions about word spelling (knowing that the answerer will always answer correctly) and binary search one million words alphabetically in 20 guesses.\n\n",

One could also pair random agents, evaluate them (see if / in how many steps they can find the keyword). This establishes for each agent, how well he cooperates with another agent. Especially, a 2 vs 2 is not necessarily required. \n\n",

By having 2 pairs, it removes this luckiness factor. (If one of the pair can do it, then it's proven to be not that hard. Except if both can't do it, then points reduced on all players aren't much.)\n\n",

Then, the performance of a team can easily be compared relative to all other teams having played that keyword. In a 2 vs 2 setting, you get signal from 2 other team playing the keyword (which is high variance). In the more general setting, you have a much richer signal as you can compare against all pairs that ever played that keyword. \n\n",
