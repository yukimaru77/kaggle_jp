        "content": "I was looking through my model logs of a new agent that I added all my changes to and I was extremely impressed later I thought that my model might be too complicated and too \"smart\" for other agents for example when my model is the questioner lower/\"dumber\" answerers might not be able to even answer correctly. I am not fully sure if this is a problem so I wanted to know what the wider community felt because I am sure that everyone who is regularly at the top has at least once considered this. Here are some images of my model's logs not sure if I just made a good/best agent or if other people already have similar results.\n\nP.S. I am not trying to be narcissistic but I just had this question after what in my mind was a \"godly\" model. I also have many more \"smart\" question images from my model but can't post them here if you want a link with a file of my agent logs I can create a google drive or something (just ask)\n\nP.P.S. Also not sure if anyone else has a model with results like this but this is my first good questioner model previously I had a good answerer that carried my score\n\n",
