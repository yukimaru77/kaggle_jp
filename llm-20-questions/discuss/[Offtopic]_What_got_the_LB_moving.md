# [Offtopic] What got the LB moving

If anyone is interested, I think the LB got moving from all 600.0 because of this lucky game where the keyword was "france". 😀 It is the only non-tied game I have seen this far.

Lucky, because the example notebook uses "france" in its few_shot_examples, which I guess primed the bot.
