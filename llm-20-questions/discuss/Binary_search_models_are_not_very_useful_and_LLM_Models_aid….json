        "content": "First of all, I will advise against binary models because as one of the competition creators says\n\n\"We will be changing out the list of words after the submission deadline and then we'll wait for the scores to stabilize. Any agent assuming a fixed word list will perform quite poorly.\"\n\nSecondly, I recently saw in my logs that I (and many other people) were going against binary search strategies. The main type of which is letter guessing strategies in which the guesser will ask if the keywords' first letter is between a-g then g-m and so on. To help my model I decided to implicitly tell it the first letter of the keyword. So inside my prompt-engineering/context, I told my model\n\nThe keyword is \"{keyword}\" and the first letter of the keyword is \"{keyword[0]}\"\n\nThis however does not help the model and instead hinders its performance and score by quite a bit. I could not imagine why this would happen and if someone had any ideas I would love to see them in the comment section.\n\nI made this discussion to advise against helping (and using) binary search models as they will also eventually be almost completely useless in the private leaderboard at the end since practically all the keywords will change.\n\nIf you find this discussion helpful please upvote. Thank you for reading and I hope this helps you!\n\n",

I think the leaderboard score is too random to consider right now, and it's better to check if the question are answered correctly.\n\nFrom what i saw in [my notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/waechter/llm-20-questions-leaderbord-analyze-best-agents?scriptVersionId=180667811&cellId=30) your agent answer questions like is the last letter of the keyword in this list correctly. So maybe your model don't need that extra help ? \n\n",
