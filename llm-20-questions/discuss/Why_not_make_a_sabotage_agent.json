However what if someone made a purposefully deceiving agent for making other agents's scores worse? Is this illegal or am I missing something? Thank you for considering my question!\n\n",

So a sabotage agent eventually will only get paired with teams on the bottom of the LB. Therefore a sabotage agent should not affect the important top of the LB.\n\n",
