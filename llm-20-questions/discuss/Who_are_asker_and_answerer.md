I was confused as I didn't know who was asking and who was answering. Is torino(me) and no apple answering? Can anyone explain?

> There are two roles questioner and answerer. The top name is questioner and the bottom name is answerer. The questioner both asks questions and makes guesses. The answerer only responds yes or no. Below is an example:

> Round 1
> Questioner: Is it a country?
> Answerer: yes
> Questioner: France?
> 
> Round 2
> Questioner: Is the country in Europe?
> Answerer: no
> Questioner: China?
