        "content": "I came across a hurdle while trying out the LLM 20 Questions Starter Notebook on Kaggle. My submission file ended up being only 11MB, way smaller than the expected 7GB+.\n\nThere was actually a message hinting at the issue: \"An attached model requires additional steps to be accessed. See the Models panel for details.\"\n\nTurns out, if you want to use the Gemma model, you need to head over to the Kaggle Models section, find Gemma, accept the license agreement, and then it'll be available for use!\n\nThanks to [@irmo322](https://www.kaggle.com/irmo322) and [@marketneutral](https://www.kaggle.com/marketneutral) for the helpful tip!\n\n",
