# Option to activate or deactivate the submitted agent? (Question to host)

My old agents are getting paused as I submit new agents. Don't you think the control should be given to the participants? My old agent was performing well compared to the new agent but my old agent got paused because of the rule. 

Suggestion: Put a limit on the active agents but the activation, deactivation control should be given to the participants.
