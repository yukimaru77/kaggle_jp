just joined the competition now and ran the LLama 8B notebook as a test submission. It works fine until one round where the agent gets penalized with -237 in one round.

The replay works fine until the very end and the agent logs don't show anything 🤷‍♂️ Did anyone encounter this issue too or knows ways to debug this?
