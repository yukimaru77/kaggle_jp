# Questions about the data

Hi, I've noticed that keywords.py gives a list of keywords. I'm wondering that whether there will be private keywords in the online evaluation? Will the categories and keywords all come from the given keywords.py through the whole competition?

According to my understanding, the categories will be stable, but the keywords will change across the whole competition, and a private word set will be used in the final period. Is that correct?
