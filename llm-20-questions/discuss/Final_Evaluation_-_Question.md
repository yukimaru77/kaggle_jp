# Final Evaluation - Question

**vj4science** *Sat Jul 27 2024 11:18:16 GMT+0900 (日本標準時)* (6 votes)

Need clarification on the below paragraph please? Does the locked 3 submissions start with a score of 600? or do they carry over previously accumulated scores from runs prior to August 13th? 

"Final Evaluation

At the submission deadline on August 13, 2024, submissions will be locked. From August 13, 2024 to August 27th, 2024 we will continue to run episodes against a new set of unpublished, secret words. During this period only your three active submissions will be eligible for the leaderboard. At the conclusion of this period, the leaderboard is final."

> Yes, the current leaderboard will be the seed of your agent going into the final evaluation period. We will ensure that agents receive enough games for the leaderboard to stabilize under the new set of words, so even if your agent is severly under ranked it should not be an issue.
