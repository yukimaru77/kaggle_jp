> In the overview, it says the following: So does this mean that in this competition, we must use LLM generation for all "questions," "guesses," and "answers"?

> Each team will consist of one guesser LLM, responsible for asking questions and making guesses, and one answerer LLM, responsible for responding with "yes" or "no" answers.

Especially, there are agents that hard-code part of the agent behaviour and even agents that fully rely on non-LLM strategies (binary search on a fixed vocabulary). The rules are not clear whether agents without a significant LLM component will be disqualified - the challenge is called LLM 20 Questions after all.
