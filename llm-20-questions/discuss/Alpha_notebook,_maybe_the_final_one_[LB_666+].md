# Alpha notebook, maybe the final one [LB 666+]

In the spirit of Conan the Barbarian and his majesty Mad Max the second! I hereby share the partial solution based on [alphabetical search](https://www.kaggle.com/code/lohmaa/llm20-agent-alpha). I spent time to make it so simple and elegant, that I am even delighted. It is not a complete solution, and that's actually splendid because it leaves room for adaptation and improvement, especially regarding the way to finish a failed alpha search.

I know some people dislike this whole idea though, perhaps because it's not based on LLMs, maybe for other reasons, but for me that's a bit irrational. Why?

First of all, it is not against the rules, and it is not unethical. Perhaps it was not entirely expected by the concept of this competition, but unexpected approaches are not a bad thing per se.

It is optimal when the keyword space is publicly known and the answerer can answer it.

Yet, contrary to some opinions, even if the keyword space is not known, it's not at all useless..

- for one, simply because one can still have many keywords on the list covered,

- for two, because one can combine it with LLMs.

There are many other solutions which basically do a similar thing, except less efficiently, e.g. asking questions about first letters, or whether the keyword is "on the following list". Even the ex-top solution so widely adored is based on such techniques. Surely there are some pros to those, too, I will not elaborate here.

Finally, as a matter of adoption -- we may say Alpha is not reliable because many agents accept the handshake and then answer the Alpha questions incorrectly, and that's a valid point. However, regardless of whether such behavior is intentional or unintentional, it is never in the legitimate interest of an agent to fail the team on purpose. So if anybody still doesn't like or believe that lexicographical search is effective, they can simply refuse the handshake and the team may try its luck in another way. In an interesting way it's a clash between rational vs irrational.
