I guess an absolute best score should be displayed there on LB.\n\nAnd how are the final bots selected for scoring at the end?\n\n[@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) \n\n",

How does that sound to you?\n\n",

            "content": "I think that this is due to the fact, that one can only have three active agents. Since there is (currently) no way to select which agents are evaluated, only the 3 most recent submissions keep participating. Also, as the score of an agent (in some way) depends on all other agents on the leaderboard and the exact scoring mechanism used at the time, it would not be correct to take the maximum score of all agents ever submitted if the agent corresponding to the maximum is no longer re-evaluated constantly. \n\nStill, I totally agree that there should be a way to select which agents to participate in the leaderboard games. \n\n",
