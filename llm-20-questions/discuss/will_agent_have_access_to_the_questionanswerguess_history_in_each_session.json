I have utilized history in my script but since our agents are teamed with an agent that could answer incorrectly/poorly a history may or may not be helpful to guess the keyword. For example in Chris's output, the agent could ask \"Is it a place?\" and the answerer agent could say \"no\" which would make attempting deductive logic difficult. This has been a fun and challenging competition! \n\n",

Thanks!\n\n",
