> Really impressive work. The idea of a think-answer approach is great. The agent managed to guess 'Danube' while the correct answer was 'Dnieper.' So close.

> Thank you for your amazing work. I have a quick question: why don’t we load the model in 8 bits instead of 4 bits? Isn’t 8 bits better?

However in this competition, we also have a compute restraint and a time limit per response. When testing ensure you stay within the allotted VRAM and the response time constraints while maximizing the model capability.
