    "Authors: Huang Hu1, Xianchao Wu, Bingfeng Luo, Chongyang Tao,Can Xu, Wei Wu and Zhan Chen\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In this paper,the authors proposed a novel policy-based Reinforce-ment Learning (RL) method, which enables the questioner agent to learn the optimal pol-icy of question selection through continuous interactions with users. To facilitate training,they also proposed to use a reward network to estimate the more informative reward. Compared to previous methods, their RL method is robust to noisy answers and does not rely onthe Knowledge Base of objects. Experimental results show that our RL method clearly outperforms an entropy-based engineering system and has competitive performance in a noisy-free simulation environment.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is not easy to design the algorithm to construct a Q20 game system. Although the decision tree based method seems like a natural fit to the Q20 game, it typically require a well defined Knowledge Base (KB) that contains enough information about each object, which is usually not available in practice. It was used a object-question relevance table as the pivot for question and object selection, which does not depend on an existing KB (Knowledge Base). Further it was improved the relevance table with a lot of engineering tricks. Since these table-based methods greedily select questions and the model parameters are only updated by rules, their models are very sensitive to noisy answers from users, which is common in the real-world Q20 games. It was utilized a value-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to improve the generalization ability but still relies on the existing KB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In this paper, the authors formulated the process of question selection in the game as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and further propose a novel policy-based RL framework to learn the optimal\n",
    "policy of question selection in the Q20 game. Their questioner agent maintains a probability distribution over all objects to model the confidence of the target object, and updates the confidence based on answers from the user.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"At each time-step the agent uses a policy network to take in the confidence vector and output a question distribution for selecting the next question. To solve the problem that there is no immediate reward for each selected question, the authors also proposed to employ a RewardNet to estimate the appropriate immediate reward at each time-step, which is further used to calculate the long-term return to train their RL model.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Their RL (Reinforcement Learning) framework makes the agent robust to noisy answers since the model parameters are fully learnable and the question distribution provides us with a principled way to sample questions, which enables the agent to jump out of the local optimum caused by incorrect answers and also introduces more randomness during training to improve the model generalization ability. Furthermore, the ability to sample questions, compared to greedy selection, also improves the diversity of the questions asked by their agent, which is crucial for user experience.\"\n",
