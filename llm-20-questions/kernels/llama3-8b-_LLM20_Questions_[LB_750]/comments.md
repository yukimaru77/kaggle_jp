> Nice simple notebook. Just FYI, people as a category has been dropped from the competition. That might help your agent stay in the search space of keywords a little better.

> Helpful notebook.

> I’m new to Kaggle and when I copied/forked it, I can’t really find the submit bottom! And there are other competitions (digit recognizer and titanic) attached to your notebook. And when I tried to create an entire notebook using Llama and copied your code there, I received an error saying that the model path isn’t correct, although it’s correct!
> 
> Can’t really understand what’s wrong!
> 
> Can you please guide me on how to fork your notebook and submit it without such errors, to see how it works, since I’m new here?
> 
> It’s too strange that the submit bottom isn’t there, and the model directory is shown to be incorrect, although it’s not!

> Thanks for your code. I submit but only get 600 on LB which used the pre-trained llama3 8b. May I ask how you get 750? Did you fine-tuned llama3 8b?
